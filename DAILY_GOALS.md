## Today's Goals - Session 2

**Session #**: 2

**Primary Goal**:
Expand to multiple domains and reach 50+ papers with diverse patterns

**Specific Tasks**:
1. Fetch 20 papers from cs.AI (computer science)
2. Fetch 15 papers from q-bio.NC (neuroscience)
3. Extract patterns from all new papers
4. Analyze pattern distribution across domains
5. Start designing find_matches.py for cross-domain matching

**Success Criteria**:
- [ ] At least 50 total papers in database
- [ ] At least 3 domains represented (physics, cs, biology)
- [ ] 30+ patterns extracted
- [ ] Pattern extraction working across different domains
- [ ] Initial design for isomorphism matching

**Time Budget**: 2-3 hours

**Building on Last Session**:
Bootstrap complete! Now expanding scope to multiple domains to enable cross-domain pattern matching.

**If I Finish Early**:
- Create examples/good_patterns.json with sample patterns
- Start implementing find_matches.py
- Look for obvious pattern similarities manually
- Add more domains (econ, math)

**If I Get Stuck**:
- Focus on data collection (fetching papers works well)
- Improve pattern extraction keywords if needed
- Document challenges in QUESTIONS.md
