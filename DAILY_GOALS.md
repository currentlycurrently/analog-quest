## Session 57 Goals (2026-02-14)

**Mission**: REACH 100 DISCOVERY MILESTONE! (99 → 100+) ✓✓✓

### Primary Goal (Quick Win!)
Curate next 5-10 candidates from Session 55 to reach 100 discovery milestone:
- Review candidates ranks 51-60 from Session 55's 1,158 pairs
- Rate candidates: excellent / good / weak / false
- Target: 1-3 new discoveries (expected 25-30% precision declining from top-50)
- Goal: 99 → 100-102 discoveries (**REACH 100 MILESTONE!**)
- Time: 30-45 minutes for quick win!

### Why This Matters
**ONE DISCOVERY AWAY FROM PSYCHOLOGICAL MILESTONE**:
- Session 56: 80 → 99 discoveries (+19, 40.4% precision in top-50)
- Session 55: 200 mechanisms → 1,158 candidates (Session 56 reviewed top 50)
- Expected precision in ranks 51-60: 25-30% (declining with lower similarity)
- **Need only 1 more discovery to hit 100!**
- Psychological milestone: 100 verified cross-domain structural isomorphisms

**Current state**:
- Total mechanisms: **200** (100% of 200 milestone - ACHIEVED!) ✓✓✓
- Total discoveries: **99** (99% toward 100 milestone - **ONE AWAY!**)
- Session 55 candidates: **1,108 pairs remaining** (Session 56 reviewed top 50)
- Session 53 candidates: 827 pairs remaining (uncurated after Session 54)
- ~395 high-value papers (≥5/10) still available for future extraction
- **Need only 1 more discovery to reach 100 milestone!**

### Strategy
**Quick curation from Session 55 candidates (Session 56 reviewed top 50)**:
1. Read candidates ranks 51-60 from examples/session55_candidates.json
2. Exclude same-paper duplicates (paper_1_id == paper_2_id)
3. Review each candidate systematically
4. Rate: excellent / good / weak / false
5. Apply quality standards from DATA_QUALITY_STANDARDS.md
6. Document structural explanations for excellent/good matches
7. Create session57_curated_discoveries.json
8. Update PROGRESS.md and METRICS.md
9. Commit changes

**Expected precision**:
- Session 56: 40.4% in top-50 (19/47 valid)
- Expected ranks 51-60: 25-30% (declining with lower similarity)
- Need to review ~10 candidates to find 1-3 discoveries

### Deliverables
1. Review candidates ranks 51-60 from Session 55 (10 candidates)
2. Rate each candidate systematically
3. Find 1-3 new discoveries (excellent or good)
4. Create session57_curated_discoveries.json with full structural explanations
5. Update PROGRESS.md: Session 57 entry
6. Update METRICS.md: 99 → 100-102 discoveries
7. Commit all changes
8. **CELEBRATE 100 DISCOVERY MILESTONE!** 🎉

### Time Estimate
- Candidate review: 20-30 min (~2-3 min per candidate)
- Documentation: 10-15 min
- Commit: 5 min
- **Total**: 35-50 minutes

### Success Criteria
**Minimum**:
- Review 10 candidates (ranks 51-60)
- Find 1 discovery (any rating)
- **Reach 100 discovery milestone** ✓

**Target**:
- Find 2-3 discoveries (expected 25-30% precision)
- Total: 99 → 101-102 discoveries
- **Exceed 100 milestone** ✓

**Stretch**:
- Review 15 candidates (ranks 51-65)
- Find 3-4 discoveries
- Total: 99 → 102-103 discoveries

## Context from Session 56

Session 56 completed curation phase:
- Reviewed 50 candidates from Session 55's 1,158 pairs (47 valid)
- Found 19 discoveries (4 excellent + 15 good)
- Total discoveries: 80 → 99 (99% toward 100 milestone!)
- Top-50 precision: 40.4% (exceeded 30-35% expectation)

**Current state**:
- **200 mechanisms extracted** (100% of 200 milestone - ACHIEVED!) ✓✓✓
- **99 verified discoveries** (99% toward 100 - ONE AWAY!)
- 1,108 Session 55 candidates remaining (uncurated)
- 827 Session 53 candidates remaining (uncurated)
- ~395 high-value papers (≥5/10) still available for extraction

**Session 56 recommendation**: Quick win - review 5-10 more candidates to reach 100 milestone (Option A)

## Workflow for Session 57 (Quick Curation)

### Step 1: Read Candidates (Ranks 51-60)
- Load examples/session55_candidates.json
- Extract candidates at indices 50-59 (ranks 51-60)
- Check for same-paper duplicates (exclude if paper_1_id == paper_2_id)

### Step 2: Review Each Candidate
- Read both mechanisms carefully
- Rate: excellent / good / weak / false
- Document structural pattern for excellent/good
- Apply quality standards from DATA_QUALITY_STANDARDS.md

### Step 3: Create Discoveries File
- Save excellent/good discoveries to session57_curated_discoveries.json
- Include full structural explanations
- Document rating reasoning

### Step 4: Update Documentation
- Update PROGRESS.md:
  - Add Session 57 entry with results
  - Update Quick Stats (99 → 100+ discoveries)
- Update METRICS.md:
  - Update Verified Discoveries section
  - Mark 100 milestone ACHIEVED
  - Add Session 57 to history table

### Step 5: Commit and Celebrate! 🎉
```bash
git add .
git commit -m "Session 57: 100 DISCOVERY MILESTONE! - 99 → 100+ discoveries"
```

**Then celebrate reaching 100 verified cross-domain structural isomorphisms!**

- `examples/session57_curated_discoveries.json` - 1-3 new discoveries with ratings
- Updated PROGRESS.md with Session 57 entry
- Updated METRICS.md with 100+ discovery milestone

---

## Alternative Options (For Future Sessions)

**Option B: Continue curation** (100+ → 110+ discoveries)
- Review next 30-40 candidates from Session 55 (ranks 61-100)
- Expected precision: 20-25% (declining with lower similarity)
- Find 6-10 more discoveries → 106-110 total
- Time: 2-3 hours

**Option C: Update frontend** (100 discoveries)
- Update app/data/discoveries.json with 70 new discoveries (30 from Session 38 + 40 new)
- Rebuild static site (100 discovery pages)
- Validate all citations working
- Deploy updated analog.quest
- Time: 2-3 hours

**Option D: Continue extraction** (200 → 230+ mechanisms)
- Extract 30-35 more mechanisms from remaining ~395 high-value papers (score ≥5/10)
- Goal: 230+ mechanism milestone
- Generate new candidate pool for future curation
- Time: 3-4 hours

## Success Path

**Session 54**: Curate candidates → 80 discoveries ✓
**Session 55**: Extract mechanisms → 200 mechanisms ✓
**Session 56**: Curate new candidates → 99 discoveries ✓
**Session 57**: Quick win → **100+ MILESTONE!** ✓✓✓
**Session 58**: Update frontend with 100 discoveries
**Session 59**: Continue extraction → 230 mechanisms OR reach 110+ discoveries

---

**You're one discovery away from 100 verified cross-domain structural isomorphisms.**
**This is a significant psychological milestone - take the quick win!**
**Then update the frontend to showcase all 100 discoveries on analog.quest.**
