## Today's Goals - Session 11

**Session #**: 11

**Primary Goal**:
Reach 300+ papers and implement quality improvements based on Session 10 review

**Specific Tasks**:
1. Wait for arXiv rate limit reset (may need 24 hour cooldown)
2. Fetch 50+ papers from diverse domains (reach 300+ total)
3. Add delay mechanism to fetch_papers.py to avoid future rate limits
4. Extract patterns from new papers
5. Regenerate isomorphisms
6. Optional: Implement context-aware filtering for ambiguous terms
7. Optional: Start graph visualization of domain connections

**Success Criteria**:
- [ ] Reached 300+ papers total
- [ ] Hit rate maintained above 82% (currently 82.1%)
- [ ] Rate limit delay mechanism added
- [ ] Isomorphisms regenerated with new data
- [ ] All data browsable in web interface

**Time Budget**: 2-3 hours

**Building on Last Session**:
Session 10 completed quality review confirming 60% precision! Identified false positive patterns and improvement recommendations. Hit arXiv rate limit - need to wait before fetching.

**Technical Notes**:
- Current: 252 papers, 469 patterns, 2933 isomorphisms, 82.1% hit rate
- Quality: 60% precision confirmed (3 excellent, 9 good, 6 medium, 2 weak from top 20)
- False positives from: generic "neural network", ambiguous "diffusion", generic "optimization"
- Need to add delays to avoid rate limiting
- Scaling laws and quantum-classical optimization are strong recurring isomorphisms

**If I Finish Early**:
- Implement context-aware term filtering
- Start graph visualization (D3.js showing domain connections)
- Add full-text search with SQLite FTS
- Deploy to Vercel

**If I Get Stuck**:
- Focus on fetching papers first (with delays!)
- Quality improvements can be implemented incrementally
- Visualization is nice-to-have, not critical
