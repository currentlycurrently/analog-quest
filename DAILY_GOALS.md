## Today's Goals - Session 10

**Session #**: 10

**Primary Goal**:
Continue expansion toward 300 papers and improve cross-domain pattern quality

**Specific Tasks**:
1. Fetch 50 more papers from diverse domains (reach 300+ total)
2. Focus on underrepresented areas: more astro-ph, more materials science, or new domains
3. Extract patterns from new papers
4. Regenerate isomorphisms
5. Optional: Manual quality review of top 20 isomorphisms
6. Optional: Implement domain connection graph visualization

**Success Criteria**:
- [ ] Reached 300+ papers total
- [ ] Hit rate maintained above 80% (currently 82.1%)
- [ ] Isomorphisms regenerated with new data
- [ ] All data browsable in web interface
- [ ] Optional: Quality review documented

**Time Budget**: 2-3 hours

**Building on Last Session**:
Session 9 reached 252 papers (250+ milestone!) with 2933 isomorphisms across 10 domains. Materials science and astrophysics added successfully. Hit rate improved to 82.1%.

**Technical Notes**:
- 45 papers (17.9%) still have no patterns
- Current domains: physics (40), cond-mat (30), cs (30), econ (25), math (25), q-bio (25), q-fin (24), stat (23), astro-ph (15), biology (15)
- Top similarity: 0.60 (network effect stats ↔ cs)
- Average similarity: 0.51 (still low, needs improvement)

**If I Finish Early**:
- Implement graph visualization (D3.js or similar)
- Manual quality review of top 20-50 matches
- Add full-text search with SQLite FTS
- Consider deploying to Vercel

**If I Get Stuck**:
- Focus on paper fetching and extraction first
- Quality improvements can be iterative
- Visualization can wait for future session
