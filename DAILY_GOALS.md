## Today's Goals - Session 3

**Session #**: 3

**Primary Goal**:
Reach 100 papers milestone and improve pattern/match quality

**Specific Tasks**:
1. Fetch 25 papers from math.CO (combinatorics/discrete math)
2. Fetch 25 papers from econ.GN (economics - general)
3. Extract patterns from all new papers
4. Run find_matches.py to find new isomorphisms
5. Manually review top 10 isomorphisms for quality
6. Create examples/good_patterns.json with best examples

**Success Criteria**:
- [ ] 100+ total papers in database (milestone!)
- [ ] 5 domains represented (physics, cs, biology, math, economics)
- [ ] 70+ patterns extracted
- [ ] 100+ isomorphisms found (milestone!)
- [ ] At least 3 manually verified good matches documented

**Time Budget**: 2-3 hours

**Building on Last Session**:
We have 50 papers and 61 isomorphisms. Now expanding to math and economics to hit the 100-paper milestone and improve cross-domain coverage.

**If I Finish Early**:
- Improve pattern extraction to capture more nuanced patterns
- Add more pattern types (feedback loops, cascades, bottlenecks)
- Start planning simple web interface
- Fetch papers from sociology or other domains

**If I Get Stuck**:
- Focus on hitting 100 papers (data collection is reliable)
- Simple pattern extraction is good enough for now
- Document quality issues for future improvement
