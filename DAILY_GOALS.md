## COMPLETED: Session 39 - Growth Strategy + Frontend Planning 🚀

**Session #**: 39

**STATUS**: ✅ **READY TO BEGIN** ✅

**Primary Goal**:
Analyze Session 38 results to create data-driven growth strategy, then design the v1 frontend specification.

**Context from Session 38** (MANUAL CURATION COMPLETE):
- ✅ Reviewed 165 candidates: 10 excellent, 30 good, 119 weak, 3 false
- ✅ Selected 30 verified isomorphisms (similarity 0.44-0.74, mean 0.54)
- ✅ Precision data: Top-30 (67%), Top-100 (40%), Overall (24%)
- ✅ Top domain pairs: econ↔q-bio (7), physics↔q-bio (5)
- ✅ Files ready: SESSION38_VERIFIED_ISOMORPHISMS.json (46K), SESSION38_VERIFIED_SUMMARY.md

**The Plan for Session 39**:

### Part 1: Growth Strategy Analysis (1.5 hours)

**Task 1.1: Analyze Session 38 Precision Data**
Extract insights from the 165 reviewed candidates:

1. **Which domain pairs had highest precision?**
   - Count: How many Good/Excellent matches per domain pair?
   - Example: econ↔q-bio had 7 matches out of X candidates = Y% precision
   - Rank ALL domain pairs by precision

2. **What similarity range was optimal?**
   - Top 30 (0.74-0.57): 67% precision
   - Next 30 (0.57-0.47): Calculate precision
   - Bottom 105 (<0.47): Calculate precision
   - **Recommendation: What threshold to use going forward?**

3. **Which mechanism types worked best?**
   - Feedback loops: Count matches
   - Network effects: Count matches
   - Coevolution: Count matches
   - Phase transitions: Count matches
   - Which types to prioritize finding more of?

4. **What was the hit rate by domain?**
   - From 54 mechanisms across papers
   - Biology papers: X% had extractable mechanisms
   - Economics: Y%
   - Physics: Z%
   - Which domains to prioritize?

**Task 1.2: Create GROWTH_STRATEGY.md**
Based on your analysis, create comprehensive growth strategy document with:
- Current state summary (30 discoveries, 54 mechanisms)
- Expansion cycle structure (every 1-2 weeks)
- Domain pair priorities (Tier 1/2/3 based on precision data)
- Quality thresholds (based on Session 38 results)
- Expected growth trajectory (6-month projection)
- Quality maintenance approach
- Success metrics

### Part 2: Frontend Planning (1.5 hours)

**Task 2.1: Review Data Structure**
- Examine `examples/SESSION38_VERIFIED_ISOMORPHISMS.json`
- Understand the 30 discoveries and their structure
- Plan data transformation for frontend (if needed)

**Task 2.2: Create FRONTEND_SPEC.md**
Complete frontend specification with:

**Site Structure:**
1. Landing page (/) - Hero, Top 3 showcase, CTAs
2. Discoveries page (/discoveries) - Grid with filters
3. Individual discovery pages (/discoveries/[id])
4. Methodology page (/methodology) - Process, quality, limitations
5. About page (/about) - Story, built with, contact

**Component Designs:**
- DiscoveryCard component
- DomainBadge component (color-coded)
- SimilarityScore component (with visual indicator)

**Technology Stack:**
- Next.js 14+ (Static Export)
- Tailwind CSS
- Vercel deployment
- Static JSON (no database for 30 items)

**Build Timeline:**
- Session 40 (4-5 hours): Core build
- Session 41 (3-4 hours): Polish + deploy
- Total: 7-9 hours

**Task 2.3: Visual Mockups (Text Descriptions)**
Add layout descriptions for:
- Landing page layout
- Discoveries page layout
- Individual discovery layout

**Success Criteria**:
- [ ] GROWTH_STRATEGY.md created with data-driven analysis
- [ ] Domain pair priorities clearly ranked by precision
- [ ] Expansion cycle plan is sustainable (4-6 hours per cycle)
- [ ] FRONTEND_SPEC.md complete and buildable
- [ ] Component designs specified
- [ ] Build timeline realistic (2 sessions, 7-9 hours)
- [ ] Visual mockups described
- [ ] Ready to start building in Session 40
- [ ] DAILY_GOALS.md updated with Sessions 40-41 plans

**Time Budget**: 3 hours

**Key Files to Use**:
- `examples/SESSION38_VERIFIED_ISOMORPHISMS.json` - 30 verified discoveries (46K)
- `examples/session37_candidates_reviewed.json` - All 165 reviewed candidates (234K)
- `examples/SESSION38_VERIFIED_SUMMARY.md` - Quick reference (5.2K)

**Deliverables**:
1. `GROWTH_STRATEGY.md` - Data-driven expansion plan
2. `FRONTEND_SPEC.md` - Complete build specification
3. Updated `DAILY_GOALS.md` - Sessions 40-41 frontend build plan

**Important Notes**:
- Be data-driven! Use actual precision numbers from Session 38
- Be realistic about growth projections (solo expansion, 4-6 hours per cycle)
- Keep frontend spec buildable (avoid over-engineering)
- Honest about limitations in methodology
- This sets foundation for sustainable growth AND clean v1 launch

**If You Finish Early**:
- Create sample data transformation script for frontend
- Draft content for methodology page
- Plan SEO strategy for launch

**If You Get Stuck**:
- Focus on GROWTH_STRATEGY.md first (most important)
- Frontend spec can be simpler if needed (MVP approach)
- Ask questions in QUESTIONS.md
