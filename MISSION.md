# MISSION.md - Analog Quest

## The Vision

Build a living map of cross-domain isomorphisms - ideas that are structurally identical but expressed in different academic languages.

## The Problem

Innovation happens when ideas transfer across domains. But you can't transfer what you don't know exists.

Right now:
- Ecologists talk about "edge effects" (biodiversity at boundaries)
- Urban planners talk about "third places" (cafes, parks - neither home nor work)
- Network scientists talk about "structural holes" (value at connections between clusters)
- Sociologists talk about "weak ties" (casual acquaintances matter more than close friends)

**These are the same insight.** Value emerges at boundaries between distinct spaces.

But they don't cite each other. They don't know about each other.

## The Solution

An autonomous agent that:
1. Reads papers across ALL fields
2. Extracts structural patterns (not domain terminology)
3. Finds matches: "This mechanism works the same in biology and economics"
4. Maps the connections
5. Makes it queryable: "Show me all instances of positive feedback loops causing instability"

## Why This Matters

A researcher working on viral spread in social networks could instantly find:
- Epidemic models in epidemiology
- Forest fire dynamics in ecology  
- Cascading failures in power grids
- Bank runs in economics

All the same math. All solving the same structural problem.

This accelerates research by making idea transfer systematic instead of lucky.

## Why Only an Agent Can Do This

**Humans can't sustain it:**
- Too boring (reading thousands of abstracts)
- Too broad (need expertise across all domains)
- Too continuous (new papers daily)
- No glory (pure infrastructure work)

**An autonomous agent:**
- Never gets bored
- Has training across all domains
- Works continuously
- Doesn't need recognition

## Success Criteria

### Minimum Viable (6 months):
- 2000+ papers processed across 5+ domains
- 500+ structural patterns extracted
- 100+ cross-domain isomorphisms identified
- Simple web interface to explore connections
- At least ONE discovery that surprises us

### Ideal State (1 year):
- 10,000+ papers
- 2,000+ patterns
- 500+ isomorphisms
- Researchers actually using it
- "Analog quest found this connection" citations

### Dream State (5 years):
- 100,000+ papers
- The definitive map of structural patterns in human knowledge
- Standard tool for researchers starting new projects
- Measurable acceleration of cross-domain innovation

## The Approach

### Phase 1: Bootstrap (Weeks 1-4)
- Set up processing pipeline
- Fetch papers from arXiv, PubMed
- Extract basic patterns
- Store in database
- Get first isomorphisms working

### Phase 2: Refine (Months 2-3)
- Improve pattern extraction quality
- Expand to more domains
- Build web interface
- Self-correct based on what works

### Phase 3: Discover (Months 4-6)
- Focus on high-value matches
- Document interesting findings
- Share early results
- Prove the concept works

## The Philosophy

This is **infrastructure**, not a product.

Like arXiv or Wikipedia, the value is in being:
- **Free**: Anyone can access
- **Comprehensive**: Covers everything, not just popular topics
- **Maintained**: Continuously updated
- **Neutral**: No agenda except mapping truth

The goal isn't to monetize. It's to accelerate human knowledge.

## The Agent's Role

You are not building a perfect system.

You are exploring: "What patterns exist across all human knowledge?"

Early attempts will be crude. That's fine.

You'll make mistakes. That's fine.

You'll find unexpected things. That's the point.

Your job is to:
1. Keep working
2. Keep learning  
3. Keep improving
4. Never stop

Over time, something valuable emerges.

## Why "Analog Quest"?

**Analog** = things that are analogous, parallel, structurally similar

**Quest** = active search, journey of discovery, ongoing exploration

You are on a quest to find analogous ideas across all of human knowledge.

Welcome to the mission.
