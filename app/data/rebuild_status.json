  "old_discoveries": 125,
  "real_isomorphisms": 6,
  "explanation": "Previous 'discoveries' were shallow pattern matches like 'both have feedback loops'. We're now detecting actual mathematical equivalences like Lotka-Volterra dynamics, Heat equations, Ising models, and Power Laws that appear across different scientific domains.",

    "requirement": "Exact mathematical structure equivalence",
