        The project has <em>no scientific advisory board</em>. The badges here

        <p className="mb-4 text-black/70">
          Every programmatic match starts at Tier 1. Moderators can promote a
          match to a higher tier only with a written justification, which
          becomes part of the public moderation log.

              Two equations from different domains normalize to the same
              canonical symbolic form. The match is a structural coincidence
              that may or may not reflect deeper mathematical equivalence.
              Tier 1 is the pipeline&apos;s default output. It is a candidate,
              not a claim.

        <h2 className="mb-4">How moderators are chosen</h2>
        <p className="mb-4 text-black/70">
          Moderators are invited by the project admin. There is no
          application form. Invitations are single-use tokens sent
          privately; anyone with a GitHub account can redeem one and become
          a moderator for the project.
        </p>
        <p className="mb-4 text-black/70">
          A moderator can promote a match to Tier 2, 3, or 4 (with note),
          reject a match (with reason), or skip. Moderators cannot create
          further moderators — only the admin can, to prevent rogue
          self-replication.
        </p>
        <p className="text-black/70">
          Any moderator action can be reversed by another moderator or by
          the admin. Every action is recorded in an append-only moderation
          log for accountability.

          A few things we want readers to know up front:
        </p>
        <ul className="list-disc pl-6 space-y-2 text-black/70">
          <li>
            Most Tier 1 matches will never be promoted. The pipeline is
            tuned to recall over precision; human review is the precision
            layer.
          </li>
          <li>
            The 2026 LaTeX canonicalizer cannot expand user-defined macros,
            handle all tensor index conventions, or recognize every
            mathematical operator. Some real cross-domain matches will be
            missed for notational reasons that have nothing to do with
            their scientific content.
          </li>
          <li>
            A Tier 2 or Tier 3 badge means a moderator read the equations
            and believed the connection was structural. It does not mean a
            domain expert in either field has endorsed the connection. Tier
            4 is the tier for that, and Tier 4 is currently empty.
          </li>
          <li>
            The moderation log is append-only but not immutable in the
            cryptographic sense — the project admin has the DB credentials
            and could edit it. The audit trail is as trustworthy as the
            admin.
