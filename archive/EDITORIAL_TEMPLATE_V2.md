## Writing Guidelines (Refined)

### Length
- **Target**: 450-600 words total
- **Trim ruthlessly**: One conceptual turn per sentence
- **Avoid**: Clause stacking, nested qualifiers

### Tone
- **Accessible but substantial**: Don't dumb down, but don't over-complicate
- **Sentences**: Short > long. Clear > clever.
- **Vocabulary**: Use domain terms when needed, but define implicitly through context

### Implications
- **Anchor in mechanism**: What does THIS structure reveal?
- **Avoid domain leaps**: Not "markets? climate? same pattern"
- **Concrete applications**: How might insights from one field inform the other?

### Titles
- **Primary (Journalistic)**: 4-10 words, catchy, invites non-experts
  - Examples: "When Free Riders Meet Epidemics", "The Advantage of Being Connected"
- **Subtitle (Mechanism)**: Abstract, theory-forward
  - Examples: "Heterogeneity's Double Edge in Cooperation Systems", "Strategic Complementarities Through Network Position"

### Evidence Basis
- **Always include**: 1-line note at bottom
- **Format**: "Based on [arXiv ID or source description]; mechanisms extracted via Analog Quest."
- **If no arXiv**: "Based on [field context, e.g., 'population biology research on cell size control']; mechanisms extracted via Analog Quest."

Shared bathrooms create free-rider problems. Disease outbreaks create cooperation dilemmas. Two research teams discovered the same counterintuitive insight: heterogeneity is a double-edged sword.

Biologists studying shared resource management asked why some people clean common spaces while others never do. They modeled contamination risk, cleaning costs, and social pressure to understand when cooperation collapses. Separately, physicists studying epidemic spread on networks asked how cooperation and disease transmission coevolve. They modeled vaccination decisions, infection risk, and network structure to understand when communities protect themselves versus succumb to outbreaks. Different questions, different fields, different math.

Analog Quest discovered both papers describe identical dynamics. The shared resource study found that cleaning costs determine whether altruistic behavior persists or collapses, with multi-stability creating abrupt shifts between cooperation and free-riding. The epidemic study found that structural heterogeneity creates leverage points (well-connected hubs adopt protection, catalyzing cooperation) and weak links (low-risk individuals free-ride, undermining immunity). Same pattern: heterogeneous incentives create both heroes and free-riders. Local incentives clash with global outcomes.

This reveals why one-size-fits-all interventions fail. In shared bathrooms, raising everyone's awareness doesn't work if free-riders don't care. In epidemic response, universal messaging doesn't work if low-risk people opt out. Both systems need targeted interventions that strengthen leverage points and eliminate weak links. The question isn't "should we account for heterogeneity?" It's "how do we design systems that amplify good heterogeneity and suppress bad heterogeneity?"

## Word Count Comparison

- **V1 (original)**: ~680 words
- **V2 (trimmed)**: ~280 words
- **Target**: 450-600 words

*Note: This example went too short. Aim for middle ground - keep substance but remove redundancy.*

## Next Steps

1. Write trimmed versions of both examples (#9, #13)
2. Validate word count: 450-600
3. Apply template to site redesign
4. Document for Session 43: "Write 12 editorials using this template"
