## PATTERN TYPE ANALYSIS: WHAT MAKES THESE 8 SPECIAL?

### Distribution of Pattern Matches

**Synchronization/Oscillation Patterns**: 6 out of 8 candidates (75%)
- Candidates 87, 91, 103, 104 are pure synchronization isomorphisms
- Candidate 88 involves bifurcation (transition variant)
- Candidate 81 involves cascade (temporal structure variant)

*Insight: Synchronization is UNIVERSAL across domains*

**Emergence/Collective Behavior**: 4 out of 8 candidates (50%)
- Pattern: Local rules → Global coordination

**Network/Topology Effects**: 2 out of 8 candidates (25%)
- Networks become structure-shaping mechanisms

**Phase Transitions**: 3 out of 8 candidates (37%)
- Threshold phenomena appear across domains

### Key Insight
These 8 candidates show physics concepts that generalize widely:
- **Synchronization** (most universal)
- **Emergent ordering**
- **Critical thresholds**
- **Cascade phenomena**

---

## WHY 42 OTHER CANDIDATES WERE REJECTED

### Rejection Categories

1. **SINGLE PATTERN MATCHING** (weakest category, n≈20)
   - Example: Candidate 82 - only "network_dynamics" match
   - Problem: Too generic - many papers discuss networks
   - Threshold: Pattern score < 3

2. **GENERIC SEMANTIC OVERLAP** (n≈15)
   - Example: Candidate 100 (info flow in sociology vs habitat in ecology)
   - Problem: Mentions similar concepts but describes different mechanisms

3. **LOW SIMILARITY SCORES** (n≈5)
   - Below 0.50 threshold → embedding model said "not that similar"

4. **WEAK DOMAIN COMBINATIONS** (n≈2)
   - Same domain pairs (not useful for cross-domain mission)

### Verdict
Most failures are at "pattern matching" level - they mention related terms but don't describe the same STRUCTURAL mechanism. This is exactly the right filter for finding genuine isomorphisms vs. superficial matches.

### Cross-Domain Novelty Score

### Similarity Score Consistency
- Range: 0.5027 to 0.5186
- All above 0.50 threshold with strong clustering (0.50-0.52)
- Consistent with medium-strength but genuine matches

### Pattern Type Reliability
- **Synchronization patterns**: Highly reliable (3+ pattern matches)
- **Emergence patterns**: Reliable (2+ pattern matches)
- **Cascade patterns**: Less reliable (1-2 pattern matches)

**Recommendation**: Prioritize the 6 synchronization-related candidates (87, 91, 103, 104, 81, 83) for validation in next review phase
