  "recommendations": [
    "Add context-aware filtering: 'diffusion model' vs 'heat diffusion'",
    "Require stronger structural overlap beyond mechanism type matching",
    "Weight shared technical terms more heavily (e.g., 'quantum-classical', 'scaling law')",
    "Filter out matches where only generic methodological terms overlap (e.g., just 'neural network')",
    "Current 60% precision is good but could reach 70-80% with these improvements"
