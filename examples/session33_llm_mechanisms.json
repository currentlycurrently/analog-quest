      "title": "Discrete dynamical systems with scaling and inversion symmetries",
      "mechanism": "System exhibits scale invariance where temporal evolution patterns repeat at different time scales. Fractal dimension characterizes chaotic regime. Inversion symmetry relates to scaling transformations, enabling efficient characterization of Lyapunov exponents (measure of chaos) with fewer iterations."

      "mechanism": "System parameter (dark energy equation of state) exhibits oscillatory behavior over time rather than constant value. Oscillation amplitude and phase affect system evolution. Multiple observational datasets constrain oscillation parameters, revealing tension between different measurement methods."

      "mechanism": "Multi-agent system where individual optimization (maximize personal yield) conflicts with collective optimization (sustain shared resource). Without coordination, agents over-exploit resource leading to collapse (tragedy of commons). Institutional mechanisms (monitoring, sanctions, communication) can shift system from competitive to cooperative equilibrium. Noise and spatial structure can trigger regime shifts between sustainable and collapsed states."

      "mechanism": "Network structure determines individual productivity through centrality measure. Agent productivity in activity A increases with connections to high-performing agents in A (complementarity). Cross-activity effect: productivity in activity A also increases from connections to high-performers in activity B (asymmetric). Scientific output enhances technological output, but not vice versa (unidirectional influence)."

      "mechanism": "Group of agents plays repeated game with public good contribution. Reciprocity mechanism: agents adjust contributions based on others' past behavior. Behavioral inertia: agents tend to maintain previous strategy. Agent identity (human vs AI) does not affect reciprocity dynamics or equilibrium cooperation level. Normative equivalence: cooperation emerges from behavior patterns, not agent classification."

Model learns this mapping from training data but fails to generalize across contexts. Feedback loop: model predictions inform experiments, experimental results update model iteratively.

      "mechanism": "One-dimensional wave propagation model enhanced with higher-dimensional correction. Short-wavelength regime requires frequency-dependent damping factor. Level-dependent feedback loop: sound level modulates damping parameter, which affects frequency selectivity. This creates nonlinear compression: gain increases slowly at high levels. Decoupling between frequency selectivity and gain through feedback."

      "mechanism": "Flow-to-stock transformation: daily incidence data (flow) must be converted to active cases (stock) using recovery rate. Exponentially-weighted convolution reconstructs prevalence from incidence over time window. Compartmental model (SIR/SEIR): population flows between states (susceptible \u2192 infected \u2192 recovered) with rate constants. Adding complexity (latency, immunity loss) doesn't fix fundamental flow-stock mismatch."

      "mechanism": "Multi-species system where species interact through chemical exchange. Species leak metabolites consumed by others (cross-feeding). Competition for shared chemicals limits coexistence (exclusion principle: N species, M chemicals \u2192 at most M coexist). High-dimensional chaos breaks exclusion: system explores large state space with intermittent switching between quasi-stable states. Chaotic dynamics enable coexistence beyond competitive limit."

      "title": "The impact of heterogeneity on the co-evolution of cooperation and epidemic spreading in complex networks",
      "mechanism": "Two coupled dynamics: cooperation level in public goods game and disease transmission rate. Structural heterogeneity: highly-connected individuals (hubs) face higher infection risk, adopt protective behavior, become cooperation leaders. This leverage point amplifies cooperation. Cost heterogeneity: individuals with low perceived risk free-ride, act as disease reservoirs, undermine collective response (weakest link). Network structure determines whether heterogeneity helps or harms."

      "mechanism": "Vegetation patches interact through local facilitation (positive feedback: neighbors help survival) and resource competition (negative feedback: neighbors deplete water). Allee effect: below threshold density, patches collapse; above threshold, patches persist. Intermittent rainfall pulses transiently enhance survival. Stochastic precipitation timing determines whether favorable events coincide spatially, affecting patch persistence. Irregular cluster patterns emerge from pulse-timing variation."

      "mechanism": "Population distributed across connected patches (metapopulation). Individuals disperse between patches via network connections. Harvesting reduces population in each patch. Two competing objectives: maximize biomass (stock) vs maximize yield (flow). Optimal strategy depends on growth rate threshold. For homogeneous patches at high growth, select patches by: intraspecific competition rate and effective net flow (determined by network connectivity)."
