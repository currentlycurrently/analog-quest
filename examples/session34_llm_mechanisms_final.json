    "mechanism": "Plants facilitate neighboring growth through local resource modification. Facilitation competes with resource competition. When precipitation is intermittent, facilitation-competition balance creates spatial vegetation patterns. Below threshold density, vegetation collapses due to weakened facilitation (spatial Allee effect).",
