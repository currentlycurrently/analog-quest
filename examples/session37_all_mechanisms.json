    "mechanism": "Allosteric regulation modulates enzyme activity temporally rather than just amplifying output. Regulatory state switches affect timing of downstream signaling. Information content in signaling depends on temporal patterns not just abundance. Regulatory switching creates temporal encoding of information. Fast switching increases information transmission while slow switching filters noise.",

    "mechanism": "Quantum systems undergo measurement-induced phase transitions when unitary evolution competes with measurements. Below critical measurement rate, volume-law entanglement dominates. Above critical rate, area-law entanglement emerges. Measurement rate acts as control parameter for phase transition. Competing dynamics create distinct entanglement phases. Multiparty entanglement structure differs across phases.",

Injection power and wavelength control dynamical regimes: analogue, spiking, or bistable responses. Nonlinearities create sharp transitions in dynamical complexity at regime boundaries. Spiking dynamics generate sparse activity patterns. Thermal bistabilities emerge at low power enhancing computational capacity. Power-wavelength phase space determines accessible dynamical states.",

Asymmetry parameter controls forward-backward correlation. Critical locus emerges where relaxation times diverge. Entropy production and predictive information depend strongly on heterogeneity but weakly on asymmetry. Near criticality, small heterogeneity changes cause large dynamical shifts.",

    "mechanism": "Under stress, cells face rapid pathway selection with ATP scarcity. Continuous ATP regeneration rescues sporulation despite 99.7% ATP depletion. GTP accumulates as energy buffer while ATP regenerates preventing complete depletion. Stochastic regulatory transitions couple to continuous metabolic flux. Energy efficiency emerges from interplay between discrete regulatory logic and continuous thermodynamic constraints. System robustness through dynamic energy management enables 16-fold efficiency gain under stress.",
