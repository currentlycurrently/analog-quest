Small subset of agents explores continuously (low threshold for action) while majority remains idle until expected reward exceeds threshold (high threshold). Information sharing across group enables synchronized action by majority when conditions improve. Optimal explorer fraction scales sublinearly with group size due to information redundancy. Ecological pressure (cost/reward ratio) modulates heterogeneity: intermediate pressure maximizes diversity, extreme conditions favor homogeneity. No central coordination required - group-level policy emerges from individual threshold rules."

Osmotic pressure drives water flow following ion movement. Cell-lumen interaction creates coupled volume dynamics. Pump rates, leak permeabilities, and osmotic coupling determine stability. Feedback between cell volume and pump activity maintains homeostasis.",
