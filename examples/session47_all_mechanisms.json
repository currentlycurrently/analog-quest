    "mechanism": "Value as set of improvable plays: In games with \u03c9-automatic preferences (DFA/parity automata), value defined as set of plays player can guarantee to improve upon relative to preference relation. Set recognized by alternating parity automaton APW of polynomial size. Contrasts with classical games using specific reward functions. \u03c9-automatic characterization enables complexity analysis: Nash equilibrium threshold problem, cooperative rational synthesis (PSPACE-complete), non-cooperative case (undecidable). Demonstrates how automata-theoretic representation affects strategic solvability."
