Small subset of agents explores continuously (low threshold for action) while majority remains idle until expected reward exceeds threshold (high threshold). Information sharing across group enables synchronized action by majority when conditions improve. Optimal explorer fraction scales sublinearly with group size due to information redundancy. Ecological pressure (cost/reward ratio) modulates heterogeneity: intermediate pressure maximizes diversity, extreme conditions favor homogeneity. No central coordination required - group-level policy emerges from individual threshold rules.",

Higher information diversity across groups promotes cooperation in multiplayer dilemmas. Update rules interact with group structure (hypergraph topology): sampling more groups increases cross-group information flow, sampling more peers within groups increases within-group consensus. Weak selection regime reveals analytical threshold for cooperation success as function of information diversity metric.
