Suppression of negative memories associated with increased posterior parietal-lateral occipital connectivity. Anxiety moderates prefrontal connectivity relationships."

    "mechanism_description": "Effective dispersal kernel encodes both microscopic dynamical parameters and network topology in coarse-grained metacommunity model. Metapopulation capacity generalizes to non-uniform local extinction rates. Stochasticity from finite carrying capacities yields reduced one-dimensional description with universal finite-size scaling laws for extinction times. Homogeneous environments require fine-tuned marginally stable coexistence to avoid monodominance."

    "mechanism_description": "Temporal niche differentiation through phenotypic plasticity in circadian rhythms enables species coexistence. Phase-locking of coupled oscillators creates temporal resource partitioning. Plasticity allows dynamic adjustment of activity timing based on competitor presence. Coexistence emerges when plastic responses generate sufficient temporal separation in resource use patterns."

    "mechanism_description": "Collective oscillations in many-body systems mediate nonlinear wave mixing without requiring strong single-particle nonlinearity. Coherent many-body response creates effective nonlinearity through collective mode coupling. Weak individual interactions amplified by collective dynamics generate strong wave mixing. Effective interaction strength scales with system size or coupling density."

Information diversity achieved through structured sampling from local neighborhoods. Adoption probability depends on group composition and size, not just neighbor count. Network hypergraph structure determines equilibrium strategy distributions through sampling bias."

Germination fraction trades off current reproduction against future survival through dormant seed bank. Optimal dormancy level depends on environmental variability - higher variance favors increased dormancy. Multi-year averaging through seed bank buffers against temporal unpredictability."

Individuals with low thresholds specialize in corresponding tasks as they activate more frequently and self-reinforce. Threshold distribution determines whether population exhibits generalism or specialized subpopulations. Decentralized coordination through threshold heterogeneity without central control."

Broad repertoire enables better pathogen recognition but limits per-clone resources. Focused expansion provides strong response to known pathogens but reduces diversity. Optimal strategy depends on pathogen encounter rate and diversity - high diversity environments favor broad repertoires despite weaker per-clone responses."
