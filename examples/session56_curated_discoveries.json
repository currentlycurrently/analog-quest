      "structural_explanation": "Both mechanisms describe how an agent's position in a collaboration network determines productivity through strategic complementarities with connected agents. The isomorphism is the asymmetric cross-domain spillover effect: activity in one domain (scientific research) enhances productivity in another domain (technological innovation), but the reverse shows no detectable influence. This reveals a universal structure: network centrality creates productivity advantages through access to diverse knowledge partners, and these advantages can transfer asymmetrically across activity domains.",
      "mechanism_1": "Firms collaborate forming innovation network. Central firms access diverse knowledge from multiple partners enhancing innovation output. Peripheral firms limited by fewer connections. Network structure (centrality) determines innovation capacity. Successful innovators attract more partners (preferential attachment) reinforcing centrality advantage.",

Higher network centrality increases output through strategic complementarities with connected agents.

      "structural_explanation": "Both mechanisms reveal how network topology creates systematic biases in information access that drive strategic behavior. In economics, agents observe only network-local peer performance (not global), creating competitive pressures that propagate through network links. In computer science, agents observe network-local samples biased by algorithmic ranking and homophily, creating distorted beliefs about opponent sophistication. The universal structure: network position → biased observation → distorted beliefs → strategic escalation beyond what accurate global information would produce.",

Risk-taking behavior adjusts based on peer comparisons. Network topology determines how competitive pressures propagate. This peer comparison mechanism affects equilibrium asset prices through aggregated strategic adjustments.",

      "structural_explanation": "Both mechanisms reveal the dual nature of heterogeneity in cooperation dynamics. Structural heterogeneity creates leverage points (highly connected hubs adopt protection due to amplified risk, catalyzing cooperation), but cost/motivation heterogeneity creates weakest links (low-risk individuals free-ride, acting as disease reservoirs that undermine cooperation). The isomorphism: heterogeneity simultaneously facilitates cooperation through influence asymmetry and degrades cooperation through motivation asymmetry. This appears in shared resource dilemmas (cleaning costs vs contamination) and disease-cooperation coevolution (network hubs vs free-riders).",
      "mechanism_1": "Shared resource use creates a cooperation dilemma with cleaning costs, contamination risk, and social incentives forming competing pressures. Cleaning cost primarily determines stability of altruistic behavior. The system exhibits multi-stability and hysteresis - small parameter changes can cause abrupt shifts between cooperation and free-riding equilibria.",

Structural heterogeneity creates leverage points - highly connected hubs adopt protection due to amplified risk, catalyzing cooperation. Cost heterogeneity creates weakest links - low-risk individuals free-ride and act as disease reservoirs, undermining cooperation. Heterogeneity is double-edged: influence asymmetry facilitates cooperation, motivation asymmetry degrades it."

In physics, higher-order structure (hypergraphs) determines imitation dynamics through group-dependent adoption rates - agents sample from local neighborhoods with bias determined by group composition. In computer science, network locality creates observation bias where agents sample biased subsets (algorithmic ranking, homophily) rather than global population. Universal structure: complex network topology → biased local sampling → distorted information → emergent behavior different from what unbiased sampling would produce.",
      "mechanism_1": "Higher-order network structure (beyond pairwise) shapes imitation dynamics through group-dependent adoption rates. Information diversity achieved through structured sampling from local neighborhoods. Adoption probability depends on group composition and size, not just neighbor count.

Good structural match across organisms showing universal control principles.",

Feedback from size to growth rate and cycle timing creates coupled dynamics. In linear regime, dynamics reduce to stochastically forced harmonic oscillator.

Good structural match showing multi-scale coupling in opinion formation.",

Similar opinions strengthen network connections. Connection strength amplifies opinion influence. This creates feedback between opinion convergence and network structure formation.

Good structural isomorphism of critical phenomena.",

The system exhibits characteristic critical exponents that govern short-time behavior, asymptotic decay, and crossover between regimes.",

Good structural match of multi-level evolutionary dynamics.",
      "mechanism_1": "Three behavioral types interact: conformists benefit from choosing common strategies, nonconformists profit from rare strategies, and imitators copy highest earners. Population proportions fluctuate in finite populations but equilibrate as population size increases. Strategy proportions undergo perpetual oscillations in small populations, but fluctuation amplitudes approach zero in large populations through stochastic averaging.",

Individual agents adapt using local signals while population composition shifts based on relative fitness. Two-layer adaptation - individual learning plus population-level evolution - determines whether strategies persist, collapse, or form coalitions."

Cooperation depends on observed group behavior patterns rather than the identity of participants. These normative mechanisms operate identically regardless of agent type, creating stable cooperation patterns through behavioral feedback.",

Environmental changes alter payoff structures, creating feedback between strategic behavior and resource dynamics.
