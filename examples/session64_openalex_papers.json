      "abstract": "The advances of machine-learned force fields have opened up molecular dynamics (MD) simulations for compounds for which ab initio MD is too resource intensive and phenomena for which classical force fields are insufficient. Here we describe a neural-network force field parametrized to reproduce the r2\u2062SCAN potential energy landscape of HfO2. Based on an automatic differentiable implementation of the isothermal-isobaric (\ud835\udc41\u2062\ud835\udc43\u2062\ud835\udc47) ensemble with flexible cell fluctuations, we study the phase space of HfO2. We find excellent predictive capabilities regarding the lattice constants and experimental x-ray diffraction data. The phase transition away from monoclinic is clearly visible at a temperature around 2000 K, in agreement with available experimental data and previous calculations. Another abrupt change in lattice constants occurs around 3000 K. While the resulting lattice constants are closer to cubic, they exhibit a small tetragonal distortion, and there is no associated change in volume. We show that this high-temperature structure is in agreement with the available high-temperature diffraction data.",

      "title": "Order parameter dynamics in complex systems: From models to data",
      "abstract": "Collective ordering behaviors are typical macroscopic manifestations embedded in complex systems and can be ubiquitously observed across various physical backgrounds. Elements in complex systems may self-organize via mutual or external couplings to achieve diverse spatiotemporal coordinations. The order parameter, as a powerful quantity in describing the transition to collective states, may emerge spontaneously from large numbers of degrees of freedom through competitions. In this minireview, we extensively discussed the collective dynamics of complex systems from the viewpoint of order-parameter dynamics. A synergetic theory is adopted as the foundation of order-parameter dynamics, and it focuses on the self-organization and collective behaviors of complex systems. At the onset of macroscopic transitions, slow modes are distinguished from fast modes and act as order parameters, whose evolution can be established in terms of the slaving principle. We explore order-parameter dynamics in both model-based and data-based scenarios. For situations where microscopic dynamics modeling is available, as prototype examples, synchronization of coupled phase oscillators, chimera states, and neuron network dynamics are analytically studied, and the order-parameter dynamics is constructed in terms of reduction procedures such as the Ott\u2013Antonsen ansatz, the Lorentz ansatz, and so on. For complicated systems highly challenging to be well modeled, we proposed the eigen-microstate approach (EMP) to reconstruct the macroscopic order-parameter dynamics, where the spatiotemporal evolution brought by big data can be well decomposed into eigenmodes, and the macroscopic collective behavior can be traced by Bose\u2013Einstein condensation-like transitions and the emergence of dominant eigenmodes. The EMP is successfully applied to some typical examples, such as phase transitions in the Ising model, climate dynamics in earth systems, fluctuation patterns in stock markets, and collective motion in living systems.",

      "abstract": "Breakthrough to the extreme properties of polymer networks relies on new insights into their molecular dynamics. Time-salt concentration superposition has been discovered in polyelectrolyte coacervate systems, proving instrumental in tuning the mechanical performance of polyelectrolyte hydrogels. However, time-salt type superposition has never been mentioned in the existing literature. Herein, we reported that the mechanical properties of poly(methacrylamide) (PMAm) hydrogel can be systematically regulated in a vast range by treating with different salts, for example, Young's modulus can be tuned from 10\u20132 to 103 MPa. The unusual behavior of salt-stiffening arises from the salt-enhanced phase separation of the polymer network and a subsequent glassy transition of the polymer-rich phase. Rheological results demonstrate that the dynamic behavior of the hydrogels can be superposed onto \"time-salt type\" master curves with the salt types aligning along the Hofmeister series. The time-salt type shift factor exhibits correlation with the mobility of water molecules as revealed by low-field nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy. A polymer\u2013water\u2013salt ternary interaction mechanism was proposed to elucidate the time-salt type equivalent behavior. Guided by the \"time-salt type\" superposition principle, a salt processing strategy was brought up to expand the property limits of the PMAm hydrogel. With simply switching the type of salt employed, the hydrogel could either be a stiff and wear-resistant material akin to glassy plastics or a soft and flowable gel utilizable for recycling.",

      "abstract": "Approaching the long-time dynamics of non-Markovian open quantum systems presents a challenging task if the bath is strongly coupled. Recent proposals address this problem through a representation of the so-called process tensor in terms of a tensor network. We show that for Gaussian environments highly efficient contraction to a matrix product operator (MPO) form can be achieved with infinite MPO evolution methods, leading to significant computational speed-up over existing proposals. The result structurally resembles open system evolution with carefully designed auxiliary degrees of freedom, as in hierarchical or pseudomode methods. Here, however, these degrees of freedom are generated automatically by the MPO evolution algorithm. Moreover, the semigroup form of the resulting propagator enables us to explore steady-state physics, such as phase transitions.",

      "abstract": "The critical brain hypothesis states that the brain can benefit from operating close to a second-order phase transition. While it has been shown that several computational aspects of sensory processing (e.g., sensitivity to input) can be optimal in this regime, it is still unclear whether these computational benefits of criticality can be leveraged by neural systems performing behaviorally relevant computations. To address this question, we investigate signatures of criticality in networks optimized to perform efficient coding. We consider a spike-coding network of leaky integrate-and-fire neurons with synaptic transmission delays. Previously, it was shown that the performance of such networks varies nonmonotonically with the noise amplitude. Interestingly, we find that in the vicinity of the optimal noise level for efficient coding, the network dynamics exhibit some signatures of criticality, namely, scale-free dynamics of the spiking and the presence of crackling noise relation. Our work suggests that two influential, and previously disparate theories of neural processing optimization (efficient coding and criticality) may be intimately related.",

      "abstract": "Evolutionarily relevant networks have been previously described in several mammalian species using time-averaged analyses of fMRI time-series. However, fMRI network activity is highly dynamic and continually evolves over timescales of seconds. Whether the dynamic organization of resting-state fMRI network activity is conserved across mammalian species remains unclear. Using frame-wise clustering of fMRI time-series, we find that intrinsic fMRI network dynamics in awake male macaques and humans is characterized by recurrent transitions between a set of 4 dominant, neuroanatomically homologous fMRI coactivation modes (C-modes), three of which are also plausibly represented in the male rodent brain. Importantly, in all species C-modes exhibit species-invariant dynamic features, including preferred occurrence at specific phases of fMRI global signal fluctuations, and a state transition structure compatible with infraslow coupled oscillator dynamics. Moreover, dominant C-mode occurrence reconstitutes the static organization of the fMRI connectome in all species, and is predictive of ranking of corresponding fMRI connectivity gradients. These results reveal a set of species-invariant principles underlying the dynamic organization of fMRI networks in mammalian species, and offer novel opportunities to relate fMRI network findings across the phylogenetic tree.",

They may display dynamics distinct from that of closed quantum systems or undergo nonequilibrium phase transitions which are not possible in classical settings. However, studying open quantum many-body dynamics is challenging, in particular, in the presence of critical long-range correlations or long-range interactions. Here, we make progress in this direction and introduce a numerical method for open quantum systems, based on tree tensor networks. Such a structure is expected to improve the encoding of many-body correlations and we adopt an integration scheme suited for long-range interactions and applications to dissipative dynamics. We test the method using a dissipative Ising model with power-law decaying interactions and observe signatures of a first-order phase transition for power-law exponents smaller than 1.",

MXenes serve an ideal paradigm for investigating the dynamic behaviors of nanoconfined water in a hydrophilic environment. Combining deep neural networks and an active learning scheme, here we elucidate the proton\u2010driven dynamics of water molecules confined between V 2 CT x sheets using molecular dynamics simulation. Firstly, we have found that the Eigen and Zundel cations can inhibit water\u2010induced oxidation by adjusting the orientation of water molecules, thus proposing a general antioxidant strategy. Besides, we also identified a hexagonal ice phase with abnormal bonding rules at room temperature, rather than only at ultralow temperatures as other studies reported, and further captured the proton\u2010induced water phase transition. This highlighted the importance of protons in the maintaining stable crystal phase and phase transition of water. Furthermore, we discussed the conversions of different water structures and water diffusivity with changing proton concentrations in detail. The results provide useful guidance in practical applications of MXenes including developing antioxidant strategies, identifying novel 2D water phases and optimizing energy storage and conversion.",

      "abstract": "The development of machine-learning interatomic potentials has immensely contributed to the accuracy of simulations of molecules and crystals. However, creating interatomic potentials for magnetic systems that account for both magnetic moments and structural degrees of freedom remains a challenge. This work introduces SpinGNN, a spin-dependent interatomic potential approach that employs the graph neural network (GNN) to describe magnetic systems. SpinGNN consists of two types of edge GNNs: Heisenberg edge GNN (HEGNN) and spin-distance edge GNN (SEGNN). HEGNN is tailored to capture Heisenberg-type spin-lattice interactions, while SEGNN accurately models multibody and high-order spin-lattice coupling. The effectiveness of SpinGNN is demonstrated by its exceptional precision in fitting a high-order spin Hamiltonian and two complex spin-lattice Hamiltonians with great precision. Furthermore, it successfully models the subtle spin-lattice coupling in $\\mathrm{BiFe}{\\mathrm{O}}_{3}$ and performs large-scale spin-lattice dynamics simulations, predicting its antiferromagnetic ground state, magnetic phase transition, and domain-wall energy landscape with high accuracy. Finally, we perform spin-lattice simulations over one million atoms across GPUs in parallel. Our study broadens the scope of graph neural network potentials to magnetic systems, serving as a foundation for carrying out large-scale spin-lattice dynamic simulations in first-principle accuracy on such systems.",

Here, we report two distinct heterogeneous nucleation facilitating single step and multistep phase transitions to global synchronization in a finite-size adaptive network due to the trade off between time scale adaptation and coupling strength disparities. Specifically, small intracluster nucleations coalesce either at the population interface or within the populations resulting in the two distinct phase transitions depending on the degree of the disparities. We find that the coupling strength disparity largely controls the nature of phase transition in the phase diagram irrespective of the adaptation disparity. We provide a mesoscopic description for the cluster dynamics using the collective coordinates approach that brilliantly captures the multicluster dynamics among the populations leading to distinct phase transitions. Further, we also deduce the upper bound for the coupling strength for the existence of two intraclusters explicitly in terms of adaptation and coupling strength disparities. These insights may have implications across domains ranging from neurological disorders to segregation dynamics in social networks.",

      "abstract": "Much of the complexity and diversity found in nature is driven by nonlinear phenomena, and this holds true for the brain. Nonlinear dynamics theory has been successfully utilized in explaining brain functions from a biophysics standpoint, and the field of statistical physics continues to make substantial progress in understanding brain connectivity and function. This study delves into complex brain functional connectivity using biophysical nonlinear dynamics approaches. We aim to uncover hidden information in high-dimensional and nonlinear neural signals, with the hope of providing a useful tool for analyzing information transitions in functionally complex networks. By utilizing phase portraits and fuzzy recurrence plots, we investigated the latent information in the functional connectivity of complex brain networks. Our numerical experiments, which include synthetic linear dynamics neural time series and a biophysically realistic neural mass model, showed that phase portraits and fuzzy recurrence plots are highly sensitive to changes in neural dynamics and can also be used to predict functional connectivity based on structural connectivity. Furthermore, the results showed that phase trajectories of neuronal activity encode low-dimensional dynamics, and the geometric properties of the limit-cycle attractor formed by the phase portraits can be used to explain the neurodynamics. Additionally, our results showed that the phase portrait and fuzzy recurrence plots can be used as functional connectivity descriptors, and both metrics were able to capture and explain nonlinear dynamics behavior during specific cognitive tasks. In conclusion, our findings suggest that phase portraits and fuzzy recurrence plots could be highly effective as functional connectivity descriptors, providing valuable insights into nonlinear dynamics in the brain.",

      "abstract": "Domain walls (DWs) are topological defects originating from phase transitions in the early Universe. In the presence of an energy imbalance between distinct vacua, enclosed DW cavities shrink until the entire network disappears. By studying the dynamics of thin-shell bubbles in general relativity, we demonstrate that closed DWs with sizes exceeding the cosmic horizon tend to annihilate later than the average. This delayed annihilation allows for the formation of large overdensities, which, upon entering the Hubble horizon, eventually collapse to form primordial black holes (PBHs). We rely on 3D percolation theory to calculate the number density of these late-annihilating DWs, enabling us to infer the abundance of PBHs. A key insight from our study is that DW networks with the potential to emit observable gravitational waves are also likely to yield detectable PBHs. Additionally, we study the production of wormholes connected to baby universes and conclude on the possibility to generate a multiverse. Published by the American Physical Society 2024",

      "abstract": "How diversity is maintained in natural ecosystems is a long-standing question in Theoretical Ecology. By studying a system that combines ecological dynamics, heterogeneous interactions, and spatial structure, we uncover a new mechanism for the survival of diversity-rich ecosystems in the presence of demographic fluctuations. For a single species, one finds a continuous phase transition between an extinction and a survival state, that falls into the universality class of Directed Percolation. Here we show that the case of many species with heterogeneous interactions is different and richer. By merging theory and simulations, we demonstrate that with sufficiently strong demographic noise, the system exhibits behavior akin to the single-species case, undergoing a continuous transition. Conversely, at low demographic noise, we observe unique features indicative of the ecosystem's complexity. The combined effects of the heterogeneity in the interaction network and migration enable the community to thrive, even in situations where demographic noise would lead to the extinction of isolated species. The emergence of mutualism induces the development of global bistability, accompanied by sudden tipping points. We present a way to predict the catastrophic shift from high diversity to extinction by probing responses to perturbations as an early warning signal.

Here, we untangle the generic conditions for synchronization transitions in a system of coupled phase oscillators incorporating the adaptive scheme encoded by the feedback between the coupling and the order parameter via a power-law function with different weights. We mathematically argue that, in the subcritical and supercritical correlation scenarios, there exists no critical adaptive fraction for synchronization transitions converting from the first (second)-order to the second (first)-order. In contrast to the synchronization transitions previously deemed, the explosive and continuous phase transitions take place in the corresponding regions as long as the adaptive fraction is nonzero, respectively. Nevertheless, we uncover that, at the critical correlation, the routes toward synchronization depend crucially on the relative adaptive weights. In particular, we unveil that the emergence of a range of interrelated scaling behaviors of the order parameter near criticality, manifesting the subcritical and supercritical bifurcations, are responsible for various observed phase transitions. Our work, thus, provides profound insights for understanding the dynamical nature of phase transitions, and for better controlling and manipulating synchronization transitions in networked systems with adaptation.",

Internal interactions and external environmental effects can lead to the removal of nodes or edges, resulting in unexpected collective behavior. For instance, a single failing node or removed edge may trigger a cascading failure in an electric power grid. This Focus Issue delves into recent advances in understanding the impacts of disruptions on networks and their system dynamics. The central theme is the disruption of networks and their dynamics from the perspectives of both data-driven analysis as well as modeling. Topics covered include disruptions in the dynamics of empirical systems such as nuclear reaction networks, infrastructure networks, social networks, epidemics, brain dynamics, and physiology. Emphasis is placed on various phenomena in collective behavior, including critical phase transitions, irregular collective dynamics, complex patterns of synchrony and asynchrony, chimera states, and anomalous oscillations. The tools used for these studies include control theory, diffusion processes, stochastic processes, and network theory. This collection offers an exciting addition to the evolving landscape of network disruption research.",

      "abstract": "Tin selenide ($\\mathrm{Sn}\\mathrm{Se}$) has recently been widely studied due to its ultralow lattice thermal conductivity and excellent thermoelectric properties. However, the thermal conductivity of the low-temperature phase of $\\mathrm{Sn}\\mathrm{Se}$ is usually overestimated with consideration of only three-phonon scattering processes and the effect of the four-phonon interaction has not been investigated. Meanwhile, it is still unclear how the widely distributed intrinsic vacancy defects, ${V}_{\\mathrm{Sn}}$ and ${V}_{\\mathrm{Se}}$, affect the lattice thermal conductivity. In this work, using the accurate first-principles-based deep-neural-network potential combined with the phonon Boltzmann transport equation and molecular-dynamics simulations, the lattice thermal conductivity of the low-temperature phase of $\\mathrm{Sn}\\mathrm{Se}$ is calculated with high-order phonon-scattering processes being considered, and the results match well with the experimental values. In addition, the effect of intrinsic vacancy defects on the thermal conductivity is also investigated using nonequilibrium molecular-dynamics simulations. The results show that the $\\mathrm{Se}$ vacancy has a more significant effect on the reduction of the thermal conductivity than the $\\mathrm{Sn}$ vacancy, due to the enhanced phonon anharmonicity attributed to the more significant vibration of the weakly bonded $\\mathrm{Sn}$ atom, as well as the appreciable inhibition of the low-frequency-phonon propagation speed. The weakening of interactions for the transition of $\\mathrm{Sn}$ atoms around vacancies from bonding with $\\mathrm{Se}$ atoms to bonding with $\\mathrm{Sn}$ atoms is the reason for the decline of the phonon group velocity. This study deepens our understanding of phonon thermal transport in the low-temperature phase of $\\mathrm{Sn}\\mathrm{Se}$ and provides a good example of using the deep-neural-network potential to explore the effects of the four-phonon interaction and intrinsic point defects on the thermal conductivity of solids.",

      "abstract": "This paper presents an integrated control algorithm of a linear quadratic static output feedback (LQSOF) controller and a nominal damping controller for an MR damper-based semi-active suspension system. It is difficult to achieve feedback control for suspension with a full-car model due to difficulties involved in estimating vehicle states and responding to high-frequency disturbances. To overcome these challenges in feedback controller implementation, the LQSOF controller is used to provide feedback on estimable states and to improve ride comfort for low-frequency disturbances. For high-frequency disturbances, the nominal damping curve of the MR damper is adjusted to reduce body vibration. The required signals are acquired using a suspension state estimator based on accelerometers that are placed on the vehicle body and wheels. The estimator is composed of a bandwidth filter and a vehicle geometry model to be implemented on a low-cost embedded ECU. The proposed algorithm was evaluated via vehicle tests with passive suspension and the originally equipped electronic control suspension system. Vehicle test results showed that, compared to the base algorithms, the proposed algorithm achieved improved ride comfort and road adhesion in various driving scenarios.",

      "abstract": "Abstract Subject training is crucial for acquiring brain\u2013computer interface (BCI) control. Typically, this requires collecting user-specific calibration data due to high inter-subject neural variability that limits the usability of generic decoders. However, calibration is cumbersome and may produce inadequate data for building decoders, especially with na\u00efve subjects. Here, we show that a decoder trained on the data of a single expert is readily transferrable to inexperienced users via domain adaptation techniques allowing calibration-free BCI training. We introduce two real-time frameworks, (i) Generic Recentering (GR) through unsupervised adaptation and (ii) Personally Assisted Recentering (PAR) that extends GR by employing supervised recalibration of the decoder parameters. We evaluated our frameworks on 18 healthy na\u00efve subjects over five online sessions, who operated a customary synchronous bar task with continuous feedback and a more challenging car racing game with asynchronous control and discrete feedback. We show that along with improved task-oriented BCI performance in both tasks, our frameworks promoted subjects\u2019 ability to acquire individual BCI skills, as the initial neurophysiological control features of an expert subject evolved and became subject specific. Furthermore, those features were task-specific and were learned in parallel as participants practiced the two tasks in every session. Contrary to previous findings implying that supervised methods lead to improved online BCI control, we observed that longitudinal training coupled with unsupervised domain matching (GR) achieved similar performance to supervised recalibration (PAR). Therefore, our presented frameworks facilitate calibration-free BCIs and have immediate implications for broader populations\u2014such as patients with neurological pathologies\u2014who might struggle to provide suitable initial calibration data.",

      "abstract": "This paper is concerned with the resilient leader-following consensus control (LFCC) of multi-agent systems (MASs) subjected to denial-of-service (DoS) attacks. Unlike most existing studies, the considered DoS attacks can independently jeopardize different communication links and are modeled using the Markovian switching phenomenon. First, a cooperative fully-distributed estimator is introduced that enables the follower agents to estimate the leader's state. The proposed cooperative estimator relaxes the requirement for knowledge about the exact leader state during the occurrence of DoS attacks. The cooperative estimator is then used to solve the resilient LFCC of MASs under two different control protocols. The dynamic state feedback (DSF)-based consensus protocol is first used to solve the fully-distributed resilient LFCC problem with cooperative estimation of the leader state. Then, to overcome the limitation of the follower's state unavailability, a novel dynamic output feedback (DOF)-based control protocol is introduced to solve the resilient consensus problem. The design conditions for the proposed estimators and controllers are derived using the Lyapunov theory. Unlike existing studies, the proposed strategy 1) employs estimated states for feedback, 2) is fully-distributed, and 3) is independent of bounds on attack frequency or duration. Finally, the applicability of the presented strategies is validated through a simulation example involving the F-18 aircraft model. <italic xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">Note to Practitioners</i> \u2014The purpose of the present work is to provide an output feedback approach for the LFCC of MASs by incorporating cyber attacks. The cyber attacks in the form of DoS while communicating over a network have been considered. The state estimation problem over a network under DoS attacks on communication links has been solved by using the cooperative estimator equation. Then, the adaptive and smoothing coupling weights are updated by applying the local estimation error. The proposed approach employs an adaptive mechanism for handling DoS attacks over the communication topology to deal with unknown connections. This mechanism does not require knowledge of the topology between agents and, consequently, does not require the central unit for implementation. Then, two approaches are used to solve the problem of resilient cooperative control: 1) by employing the estimation of the leader's state only; 2) by employing both estimates of the leader's and followers' states. The proposed approach can be applied practically by solving cooperative and conventional observers along with adaptation weights, recursively, in addition to an algebraic equation for estimated state feedback. Moreover, the presented method can deal with independent attacks on different communication channels, which is a practical scenario. The proposed approach can be applied to consensus and formation control applications under cyber attacks, like the formation of aircrafts, consensus in robots, and synchronization in power systems. The presented approach has been applied to attain consensus in F-18 aircrafts, and simulation results are shown.",

      "abstract": "Electro-hydraulic actuators (EHAs) are key linear drive components in various industrial applications. This paper addresses the challenge of achieving precise displacement tracking control for EHAs with only noisy displacement measurements. We propose a novel control approach, which consists of a Kalman extended state observer (KESO) with an adaptive sliding mode controller (ASMC). First, compared to the conventional high-gain design for the extended state observer (ESO), the Kalman filtering technique is utilized to tune the ESO feedback gain, effectively mitigating observation failures caused by measurement noise. Second, to ensure stability and minimize tracking errors in sliding mode control, a switching-gain adaptation is designed based on the desired switching gain via the derivative of the sliding variable. To validate the effectiveness of the proposed approach, simulation experiments are conducted in the Amesim simulation software. The results conclusively demonstrate that the proposed KESO-ASMC achieves significantly improved trajectory tracking performance, even in the presence of measurement noise and unknown disturbances.",

A trend that is attributed to the availability of better quality, less costly, and easier-to-use devices. However, consensus is yet to emerge over the most optimal combinations. In this review, the aim is to clarify the best examples of biosensor usage in combination with iVR applications. The high number of papers in the review (560) were classified into the following seven fields of application: psychology, medicine, sports, education, ergonomics, military, and tourism and marketing. The use of each type of wearable biosensor and Head-Mounted Display was analyzed for each field of application. Then, the development of the iVR application is analyzed according to its goals, user interaction levels, and the possibility of adapting the iVR environment to biosensor feedback. Finally, the evaluation of the iVR experience was studied, considering such issues as sample size, the presence of a control group, and post-assessment routines. A working method through which the most common solutions, the best practices, and the most promising trends in biofeedback-based iVR applications were identified for each field of application. Besides, guidelines oriented towards good practice are proposed for the development of future iVR with biofeedback applications. The results of this review suggest that the use of biosensors within iVR environments need to be standardized in some fields of application, especially when considering the adaptation of the iVR experience to real-time biosignals to improve user performance.",

      "abstract": "Abstract Adaptive learning technologies are closely related to learners' self\u2010regulatory processes in individual and collaborative learning. This study presents the outcomes of a systematic literature review of empirical evidence on adaptive learning environments to foster self\u2010regulation and shared regulation of learning in collaborative settings. We provide an overview of what and how adaptive technologies have been used to understand and promote self\u2010regulated learning in collaborative contexts. A search resulted in 38 papers being analysed. Specifically, we identified the seven main objectives (feedback and scaffolding, self\u2010regulatory skills and strategies, learning trajectories, collaborative learning processes, adaptation and regulation, self\u2010assessment, and help\u2010seeking behaviour) that the adaptive technology research has been focusing on. We also summarize the implications derived from the reviewed papers and frame them within seven thematic areas. Finally, this review stresses that future research should consider developing a converging theoretical framework that would enable concrete monitoring and support for self\u2010regulation and socially shared regulation of learning. Our findings set a baseline to support the adoption and proliferation of adaptive learning technology within self\u2010regulated learning research and development. Practitioner notes What is already known about this topic By providing personalized and learner\u2010centric adaptive learning environments (ADLEs), adaptive learning technology can support and foster self\u2010regulated learning (SRL) practices. It is possible to create a more student\u2010centred and effective learning environment by combining adaptive learning and collaborative learning. Socially shared regulatory activities can involve planning, monitoring, controlling and reflecting on a group's learning processes. What this paper adds Provides a systematic literature review of empirical evidence on ADLEs, SRL and socially shared regulation of learning (SSRL) in collaborative contexts. Summarizes the insights on (S)SRL through ADLEs in collaborative learning. Identifies challenges and opportunities for ADLEs to support (S)SRL in collaborative learning. Implications for practice and/or policy Learning analytics and educational technology researchers will be able to use the systematic review as a guide for future research. Learning analytics and educational technology practitioners will be able to use the systematic review as a summary of the field's current state.",

      "abstract": "Abstract With the discovery of event\u2010related potentials elicited by errors more than 30 years ago, a new avenue of research on performance monitoring, cognitive control, and decision making emerged. Since then, the field has developed and expanded fulminantly. After a brief overview on the EEG correlates of performance monitoring, this article reviews recent advancements based on single\u2010trial analyses using independent component analysis, multiple regression, and multivariate pattern classification. Given the close interconnection between performance monitoring and reinforcement learning, computational modeling and model\u2010based EEG analyses have made a particularly strong impact. The reviewed findings demonstrate that error\u2010 and feedback\u2010related EEG dynamics represent variables reflecting how performance\u2010monitoring signals are weighted and transformed into an adaptation signal that guides future decisions and actions. The model\u2010based single\u2010trial analysis approach goes far beyond conventional peak\u2010and\u2010trough analyses of event\u2010related potentials and enables testing mechanistic theories of performance monitoring, cognitive control, and decision making.",

      "abstract": "Standing up from a chair is a key daily life activity that is sensitive to functional limitations as we age and associated with falls, frailty, and institutional living. Predictive neuromusculoskeletal models can potentially shed light on the interconnectivity and interdependency of age-related changes in neuromuscular capacity, reinforcement schemes, sensory integration, and adaptation strategies during stand-up. Most stand-up movements transfer directly into walking (sit-to-walk). The aim of this study was to develop and validate a neuromusculoskeletal model with reflex-based muscle control that enables simulation of the sit-to-walk movement under various conditions (seat height, foot placement). We developed a planar sit-to-walk musculoskeletal model (11 degrees-of-freedom, 20 muscles) and neuromuscular controller, consisting of a two-phase stand-up controller and a reflex-based gait controller. The stand-up controller contains generic neural pathways of delayed proprioceptive feedback from muscle length, force, velocity, and upper-body orientation (vestibular feedback) and includes both monosynaptic an antagonistic feedback pathways. The control parameters where optimized using a shooting-based optimization method, based on a high-level optimization criterium. Simulations were compared to recorded kinematics, ground reaction forces, and muscle activation. The simulated kinematics resemble the measured kinematics and muscle activations. The adaptation strategies that resulted from alterations in seat height, are comparable to those observed in adults. The simulation framework and model are publicly available and allow to study age-related compensation strategies, including reduced muscular capacity, reduced neural capacity, external perturbations, and altered movement objectives.",

      "abstract": "The holistic growth and psychological well-being of people with special needs and disabilities remain high on the priority agenda for sustainable and inclusive education. Digital well-being technologies and especially \u201csmart technologies\u201d, are ready to revolutionize mental health interventions by meeting trainees\u2019 needs and providing them with more positive and transformative mental, emotional, and social experiences. \u039ceta-skills refer to a set of consciousness-raising competences that incorporate meta-cognitive, social\u2013emotional, and motivational attributes, allowing individuals to intentionally achieve a state of optimal functioning. Although positive psychology and well-being technologies are considered promising intervention approaches, there is less knowledge regarding the effectiveness of such interventions among people with special needs and disabilities, especially in the crucial domain of meta-skills development. Thus, the current systematic review aims to examine positive psychology strategies as well as the synergy with well-being technologies in the development of metacognition, emotional intelligence, and motivation meta-skills in populations with special training needs and disabilities. The PRISMA methodology was utilized to answer the research questions. A total of forty-nine studies met the inclusion criteria. The results indicated that positive psychology strategies improved a wide range of meta-skills, including self-regulation, emotional control, behavioral control, inhibition control, self-awareness, intrapersonal skills, interpersonal skills, adaptation, goal setting, and self-compassion. Artificial intelligence tools, wearables, smart applications, immersive technologies (virtual and augmented reality), neurofeedback and biofeedback technologies, as well as digital games were found to effectively assist such training programs. The results of the current review may provide positive feedback in the discussion about digitally-aided mental health interventions for training the meta-skills of mental and emotional health.",

Here, we present a case in which a visually impaired individual with bilateral burn injury amputation was provided with a novel transradial neuromusculoskeletal prosthesis comprising skeletal attachment via osseointegration and implanted electrodes in nerves and muscles for control and sensory feedback. Difficulties maintaining implant hygiene and donning and doffing the prosthesis arose due to his contralateral amputation, ipsilateral eye loss, and contralateral impaired vision necessitating continuous adaptations to the electromechanical interface. Despite these setbacks, the participant still demonstrated improvements in functional outcomes and the ability to control the prosthesis in various limb positions using the implanted electrodes. Our results demonstrate the importance of a multidisciplinary, iterative, and patient-centered approach to making cutting-edge technology accessible to patients with high levels of impairment.",

This approach involves a transformation of the model into a Brunovsky canonical form, effectively addressing the nonlinear challenges arising from the CPL and the nonminimum phase characteristics of the boost converter. Subsequently, guided by the Lyapunov approach, an adaptation law is established to fine-tune the controller\u2019s gain vector, facilitating the tracking of a predefined linearizing feedback control.

As an illustration, we apply our framework to the adaptation of gene-regulatory networks under a dynamic genotype-phenotype map: phenotypic variations are shaped by the fast stochastic gene-expression dynamics and are coupled to the slowly evolving distribution of genotypes, each encoded by a network structure. We establish that under this map, genotypes corresponding to reciprocal networks of coherent feedback loops are selected within an intermediate range of environmental noise, leading to phenotypic robustness.",

      "abstract": "The adaptation underlying many realistic processes plays a pivotal role in shaping the collective dynamics of diverse systems. Here, we untangle the generic conditions for synchronization transitions in a system of coupled phase oscillators incorporating the adaptive scheme encoded by the feedback between the coupling and the order parameter via a power-law function with different weights. We mathematically argue that, in the subcritical and supercritical correlation scenarios, there exists no critical adaptive fraction for synchronization transitions converting from the first (second)-order to the second (first)-order. In contrast to the synchronization transitions previously deemed, the explosive and continuous phase transitions take place in the corresponding regions as long as the adaptive fraction is nonzero, respectively. Nevertheless, we uncover that, at the critical correlation, the routes toward synchronization depend crucially on the relative adaptive weights. In particular, we unveil that the emergence of a range of interrelated scaling behaviors of the order parameter near criticality, manifesting the subcritical and supercritical bifurcations, are responsible for various observed phase transitions. Our work, thus, provides profound insights for understanding the dynamical nature of phase transitions, and for better controlling and manipulating synchronization transitions in networked systems with adaptation.",

      "abstract": "In weak grid, feedforward of grid voltage control is widely used to effectively suppress grid-side current distortion of inverters caused by harmonics in point of common coupling (PCC) voltage. However, due to its introduction of a positive feedback loop related to the grid impedance, it results in a significant reduction in the system phase margin. In view of this, in this paper, the output impedance of a three-phase LCL grid-connected inverter under a quasi-proportional resonant (QPR) controller is first modeled. Instead of the traditional grid voltage feedforward control strategy, a band-pass filter is added to the grid voltage feedforward channel. Secondly, a multi-objective constraint method is proposed to make improvements to the feedforward function. Then, a multi-objective constraint function is established with the constraints of base-wave current tracking performance, system stability margin, and low-frequency amplitude, and the feasibility of its function optimization design method is verified. Theoretical analysis shows that the optimized grid voltage feedforward control strategy can effectively reshape the phase characteristics of the system output impedance, which greatly broadens the adaptation range of the system to the grid impedance. Finally, the effectiveness of the proposed control strategy is verified by building a semi-physical simulation experimental platform based on RT-LAB OP4510.",

      "abstract": "The intimate relationship between the epithelium and immune system is crucial for maintaining tissue homeostasis, with perturbations therein linked to autoimmune disease and cancer<sup>1-3</sup>. Whereas stem cell-derived organoids are powerful models of epithelial function<sup>4</sup>, they lack tissue-resident immune cells that are essential for capturing organ-level processes. We describe human intestinal immuno-organoids (IIOs), formed through self-organization of epithelial organoids and autologous tissue-resident memory T (T<sub>RM</sub>) cells, a portion of which integrate within the epithelium and continuously survey the barrier. T<sub>RM</sub> cell migration and interaction with epithelial cells was orchestrated by T<sub>RM</sub> cell-enriched transcriptomic programs governing cell motility and adhesion. We combined IIOs and single-cell transcriptomics to investigate intestinal inflammation triggered by cancer-targeting biologics in patients. Inflammation was associated with the emergence of an activated population of CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells that progressively acquired intraepithelial and cytotoxic features. The appearance of this effector population was preceded and potentiated by a T helper-1-like CD4<sup>+</sup> population, which initially produced cytokines and subsequently became cytotoxic itself. As a system amenable to direct perturbation, IIOs allowed us to identify the Rho pathway as a new target for mitigation of immunotherapy-associated intestinal inflammation. Given that they recapitulate both the phenotypic outcomes and underlying interlineage immune interactions, IIOs can be used to study tissue-resident immune responses in the context of tumorigenesis and infectious and autoimmune diseases.",

      "abstract": "Abstract Buildup and switching mechanisms of solitons in complex nonlinear systems are fundamentally important dynamical regimes. Using a novel strongly nonlinear optical system, including saturable absorber metal\u2010organic framework (MOF)\u2010253@Au and a polarization controller (PC), the work reveals a new buildup scenario for \u201csoliton molecules (SMs)\u201d, which includes a long\u2010duration stage dominated by the emergence of transient noise\u2010like pulses (NLPs) modes to withstand strong disturbances arising from \u201cturbulence\u201d and extreme nonlinearity in the optical cavity. The switching between SMs and NLPs is controlled by the cavity polarization state. The switching involves the spectral collapse, following spectral oscillations with a variable period, and self\u2010organization of NLPs, following energy overshoot. This switching mechanism applies to various patterns with single, paired, and clustered pulses. In the multi\u2010pulses stage, XPM (cross\u2010phase\u2010modulation)\u2010induced interactions between solitons facilitate a specific mode of energy exchange between them, proportional to interaction duration, ensuring pulse stability during and after state transitions. Systematic simulations reveal the effects of the PC's rotation angle and intra\u2010cavity nonlinearity on the periodic phase transitions between the different soliton states and accurately reproduce the experimentally observed buildup and switching mechanisms. These findings can enhance the fundamental study and points to potential uses in designing information encoding systems.",

      "abstract": "We investigate collective dynamics in a binary mixture of programmable robots in experiments and simulations. While robots of the same species align their motion direction, interaction between species is distinctly nonreciprocal: species A aligns with B and species B antialigns with A. This nonreciprocal interaction gives rise to the emergence of collective chiral motion that can be stabilized by limiting the robot angular speed to be below a threshold. Within the chiral phase, increasing the robot density or extending the range of local repulsive interactions can drive the system through an absorbing-active transition. At the transition point, the robots exhibit a remarkable capacity for self-organization, forming disordered hyperuniform states.",

      "abstract": "Traditional heat conductive epoxy composites often fall short in meeting the escalating heat dissipation demands of large\u2010power, high\u2010frequency, and high\u2010voltage insulating packaging applications, due to the challenge of achieving high thermal conductivity ( k ), desirable dielectric performance, and robust thermomechanical properties simultaneously. Liquid crystal epoxy (LCE) emerges as a unique epoxy, exhibiting inherently high k achieved through the self\u2010assembly of mesogenic units into ordered structures. This characteristic enables liquid crystal epoxy to retain all the beneficial physical properties of pristine epoxy, while demonstrating a prominently enhanced k . As such, liquid crystal epoxy materials represent a promising solution for thermal management, with potential to tackle the critical issues and technical bottlenecks impeding the increasing miniaturization of microelectronic devices and electrical equipment. This article provides a comprehensive review on recent advances in liquid crystal epoxy, emphasizing the correlation between liquid crystal epoxy's microscopic arrangement, organized mesoscopic domain, k , and relevant physical properties. The impacts of LC units and curing agents on the development of ordered structure are discussed, alongside the consequent effects on the k , dielectric, thermal, and other properties. External processing factors such as temperature and pressure and their influence on the formation and organization of structured domains are also evaluated. Finally, potential applications that could benefit from the emergence of liquid crystal epoxy are reviewed.",

We then discuss some of the identity challenges often encountered by emerging female leaders. Following this, we outline the key practical elements of a development program (intervention) that was run with emerging female leaders across two geographic regions. The positive outcomes of the program in terms of developing self-efficacy, motivation to lead and leadership identity are presented. We then distil the specific areas that practitioners need to focus on in implementing a leadership development program within their own context and how this helps towards building PsyCap.",

      "abstract": "Abstract. Dissolution and precipitation processes in reactive transport in porous media are ubiquitous in a multitude of contexts within the field of Earth sciences. In particular, the dynamic interaction between the reactive dissolution and precipitation processes and the solute transport is of interest as it is capable of giving rise to the emergence of preferential flow paths in the porous host matrix. It has been shown that the emergence of preferential flow paths can be considered to be a manifestation of transport self-organization in porous media as these create spatial gradients that distance the system from the state of perfect mixing and allow for a faster and more efficient fluid transport through the host matrix. To investigate the dynamic feedback between the transport and the reactive processes in the field and its influence on the emergence of transport self-organization, we consider a two-dimensional Darcy-scale formulation of a reactive-transport setup, where the precipitation and dissolution of the host matrix are driven by the injection of an acid compound, establishing local equilibrium with the resident fluid and an initially homogeneous porous matrix, composed of a calcite mineral. The coupled reactive process is simulated in a series of computational analyses employing the Lagrangian particle-tracking (LPT) approach, capable of capturing the subtleties of the multiple-scale heterogeneity phenomena. We employ the Shannon entropy to quantify the emergence of self-organization in the field, which we define as a relative reduction in entropy compared to its maximum value. Scalability of the parameters, which characterize the evolution of the reactive process, with the Peclet number in an initially homogeneous field is derived using a simple one-dimensional ADRE model with a linear adsorption reaction term and is then confirmed through numerical simulations, with the global reaction rate, the mean value, and the variance of the hydraulic-conductivity distribution in the field all exhibiting dependency on the reciprocal of the Peclet number. Our findings show that transport self-organization in an initially homogeneous field increases with time, along with the emergence of the field heterogeneity due to the interaction between the transport and reactive processes. By studying the influence of the Peclet number on the reactive process, we arrive at a conclusion that self-organization is more pronounced in diffusion-dominated flows, characterized by small Peclet values. The self-organization of the breakthrough curve exhibits the opposite tendencies, which are observed from the perspective of a thermodynamic analogy. The hydraulic power, required to maintain the driving head pressure difference between the inlet and outlet of the field, was shown to increase with the increasing variance, as well as with the increasing mean value of the hydraulic-conductivity distribution in the field, using a simple analytic model. This was confirmed by numerical experiments. This increase in power, supplied to the flow in the field, results in an increase in the level of transport self-organization. Employing a thermodynamic framework to investigate the dynamic reaction\u2013transport interaction in porous media may prove to be beneficial whenever the need exists to establish relations between the intensification of the preferential flow path phenomenon, represented by a decline in the Shannon entropy of the transport, with the amount of reaction that occurred in the porous medium and the change in its heterogeneity.",

      "abstract": "Abstract During host infection, Toxoplasma gondii and related unicellular parasites move using gliding, which differs fundamentally from other known mechanisms of eukaryotic cell motility. Gliding is thought to be powered by a thin layer of flowing filamentous (F)-actin sandwiched between the plasma membrane and a myosin-covered inner membrane complex. How this surface actin layer drives the various gliding modes observed in experiments\u2014helical, circular, twirling and patch, pendulum or rolling\u2014is unclear. Here we suggest that F-actin flows arise through self-organization and develop a continuum model of emergent F-actin flow within the confines provided by Toxoplasma geometry. In the presence of F-actin turnover, our model predicts the emergence of a steady-state mode in which actin transport is largely directed rearward. Removing F-actin turnover leads to actin patches that recirculate up and down the cell, which we observe experimentally for drug-stabilized actin bundles in live Toxoplasma gondii parasites. These distinct self-organized actin states can account for observed gliding modes, illustrating how different forms of gliding motility can emerge as an intrinsic consequence of the self-organizing properties of F-actin flow in a confined geometry.",

      "title": "Modeling and Predicting Self-Organization in Dynamic Systems out of Thermodynamic Equilibrium: Part 1: Attractor, Mechanism and Power Law Scaling",
      "abstract": "Self-organization in complex systems is a process associated with reduced internal entropy and the emergence of structures that may enable the system to function more effectively and robustly in its environment and in a more competitive way with other states of the system or with other systems. This phenomenon typically occurs in the presence of energy gradients, facilitating energy transfer and entropy production. As a dynamic process, self-organization is best studied using dynamic measures and principles. The principles of minimizing unit action, entropy, and information while maximizing their total values are proposed as some of the dynamic variational principles guiding self-organization. The least action principle (LAP) is the proposed driver for self-organization; however, it cannot operate in isolation; it requires the mechanism of feedback loops with the rest of the system\u2019s characteristics to drive the process. Average action efficiency (AAE) is introduced as a potential quantitative measure of self-organization, reflecting the system\u2019s efficiency as the ratio of events to total action per unit of time. Positive feedback loops link AAE to other system characteristics, potentially explaining power\u2013law relationships, quantity\u2013AAE transitions, and exponential growth patterns observed in complex systems. To explore this framework, we apply it to agent-based simulations of ants navigating between two locations on a 2D grid. The principles align with observed self-organization dynamics, and the results and comparisons with real-world data appear to support the model. By analyzing AAE, this study seeks to address fundamental questions about the nature of self-organization and system organization, such as \u201cWhy and how do complex systems self-organize? What is organization and how organized is a system?\u201d. We present AAE for the discussed simulation and whenever no external forces act on the system. Given so many specific cases in nature, the method will need to be adapted to reflect their specific interactions. These findings suggest that the proposed models offer a useful perspective for understanding and potentially improving the design of complex systems.",

      "abstract": "Collective ordering behaviors are typical macroscopic manifestations embedded in complex systems and can be ubiquitously observed across various physical backgrounds. Elements in complex systems may self-organize via mutual or external couplings to achieve diverse spatiotemporal coordinations. The order parameter, as a powerful quantity in describing the transition to collective states, may emerge spontaneously from large numbers of degrees of freedom through competitions. In this minireview, we extensively discussed the collective dynamics of complex systems from the viewpoint of order-parameter dynamics. A synergetic theory is adopted as the foundation of order-parameter dynamics, and it focuses on the self-organization and collective behaviors of complex systems. At the onset of macroscopic transitions, slow modes are distinguished from fast modes and act as order parameters, whose evolution can be established in terms of the slaving principle. We explore order-parameter dynamics in both model-based and data-based scenarios. For situations where microscopic dynamics modeling is available, as prototype examples, synchronization of coupled phase oscillators, chimera states, and neuron network dynamics are analytically studied, and the order-parameter dynamics is constructed in terms of reduction procedures such as the Ott\u2013Antonsen ansatz, the Lorentz ansatz, and so on. For complicated systems highly challenging to be well modeled, we proposed the eigen-microstate approach (EMP) to reconstruct the macroscopic order-parameter dynamics, where the spatiotemporal evolution brought by big data can be well decomposed into eigenmodes, and the macroscopic collective behavior can be traced by Bose\u2013Einstein condensation-like transitions and the emergence of dominant eigenmodes. The EMP is successfully applied to some typical examples, such as phase transitions in the Ising model, climate dynamics in earth systems, fluctuation patterns in stock markets, and collective motion in living systems.",

      "abstract": "Purpose Empowering leadership has a wide range of positive individual employee-related outcomes. However, a limited number of research studies are available emphasizing the overall organization-related outcomes. The major aim of this study is to delve into the function of organizational identification and intellectual capital (structural, relational and human) in mediating the relationship between empowering leadership and organizational innovativeness. Depending upon the resource-based view theory, this study comprehensively investigates the sequential effects of empowered leadership on the mediating roles of organizational identification and intellectual capital in organizational innovativeness. Design/methodology/approach Data were gathered through a self-administered questionnaire, which got 337 responses from telecom employees. To evaluate the hypotheses, the data were analyzed in SEM-M-Plus using exploratory and confirmatory factor analyses. Findings The findings demonstrate that empowering leadership impacts organizational innovativeness with the sequential mediation of organizational identification and intellectual capital (structural, human and social). Practical implications Organizations can identify and encourage leaders who exhibit empowering behaviors such as delegating responsibilities, providing autonomy and fostering a sense of ownership among employees. Also, organizations can foster intellectual capital by providing opportunities for learning, training and development. Additionally, knowledge sharing and collaboration can help to enhance the intellectual capital of employees. Originality/value While much research has been conducted on empowering leadership, the continued development of knowledge and the emergence of new perspectives related to identification and intellectual capital highlights the importance of exploring alternative paths that have been overlooked. Therefore, there is a pressing need to conduct research that takes into account these additional factors.",

An essential crosstalk is in the neuromusculoskeletal (NMS) axis involving neural, muscular, and skeletal tissues, which is challenging to model using human cells. Here, we describe the generation of three-dimensional, NMS tri-tissue organoids (hNMSOs) from human pluripotent stem cells through a co-development strategy. Staining, single-nucleus RNA sequencing, and spatial transcriptome profiling revealed the co-emergence and self-organization of neural, muscular, and skeletal lineages within individual organoids, and the neural domains of hNMSOs obtained a ventral-specific identity and produced motor neurons innervating skeletal muscles. The neural, muscular, and skeletal regions of hNMSOs exhibited maturation and established functional connections during development. Notably, structural, functional, and transcriptomic analyses revealed that skeletal support in hNMSOs benefited human muscular development. Modeling with hNMSOs also unveiled the neuromuscular alterations following pathological skeletal degeneration. Together, our study provides an accessible experimental model for future studies of human NMS crosstalk and abnormality.",

      "abstract": "The emergence of security vulnerabilities and risks in software development assisted by self-generated tools, particularly with regard to the generation of code that lacks due consideration of security measures, could have significant consequences for industry and its organizations. This manuscript aims to demonstrate how such self-generative vulnerabilities manifest in software programming, through a case study. To this end, this work undertakes a methodology that illustrates a practical example of vulnerability existing in the code generated using an AI model such as ChatGPT, showcasing the creation of a web application database, SQL queries, and PHP server-side. At the same time, the experimentation details a step-by-step SQL injection attack process, highlighting the hacker\u2019s actions to exploit the vulnerability in the website\u2019s database structure, through iterative testing and executing SQL commands to gain access to sensitive data. Recommendations on effective prevention strategies include training programs, error analysis, responsible attitude, integration of tools and audits in software development, and collaboration with third parties. As a result, this manuscript discusses compliance with regulatory frameworks such as GDPR and HIPAA, along with the adoption of standards such as ISO/IEC 27002 or ISA/IEC 62443, for industrial applications. Such measures lead to the conclusion that incorporating secure coding standards and guideline\u2014from organizations such as OWASP and CERT training programs\u2014further strengthens defenses against vulnerabilities introduced by AI-generated code and novice programming errors, ultimately improving overall security and regulatory compliance.",

      "abstract": "Understanding the behavior of complex chemical reaction networks and how environmental conditions can modulate their organization as well as the associated outcomes may take advantage of the design of related artificial systems. Microenvironments with defined boundaries are of particular interest for their unique properties and prebiotic significance. Dynamic covalent libraries (DCvLs) and their underlying constitutional dynamic networks (CDNs) have been shown to be appropriate for studying adaptation to several processes, including compartmentalization. However, microcompartments (e.g., micelles) provide specific environments for the selective protection from interfering reactions such as hydrolysis and an enhanced chemical promiscuity due to the interface, governing different processes of network modulation. Different interactions between the micelles and the library constituents lead to dynamic sensing, resulting in different expressions of the network through pattern generation. The constituents integrated into the micelles are protected from hydrolysis and hence preferentially expressed in the network composition at the cost of constitutionally linked members. In the present work, micellar integration was observed for two processes: internal uptake based on hydrophobic forces and interfacial localization relying on attractive electrostatic interactions. The latter drives a complex triple adaptation of the network with feedback on the shape of the self-assembled entity. Our results demonstrate how microcompartments can enforce the expression of constituents of CDNs by reducing the hydrolysis of uptaken members, unravelling processes that govern the response of reactions networks. Such studies open the way toward using DCvLs and CDNs to understand the emergence of complexity within reaction networks by their interactions with microenvironments.",

      "abstract": "ABSTRACT The spontaneous emergence of tissue patterns is often attributed to biochemical reaction-diffusion systems. In Hydra tissue regeneration, the formation of a Wnt signaling center serves as a well-known example of such a process. However, despite extensive research, a strictly biochemical mechanism for self-organization in Hydra remains elusive. In this study, we investigated mechanical stimuli and identified a positive feedback loop between Wnt signaling and tissue stretching. We developed a mathematical model of mechanochemical pattern formation in a closed elastic shell, representing regenerating Hydra epithelial spheroids. Our model explains how mechanical forces drive axis formation and predicts the organizer\u2019s location under various perturbations, providing a more comprehensive understanding of the spatial dynamics involved. Validation by partially confining regenerating tissues showed that the organizer indeed forms in regions with the greatest stretching potential. This work highlights a novel mechanochemical mechanism for luminal epithelium patterning, suggesting that mechanical forces, in addition to biochemical signals, play a crucial role in tissue regeneration and axis specification. Our findings offer broader implications for the role of mechanical forces in tissue organization in various biological systems, opening new avenues for investigating mechanochemical feedback in development and regeneration.",

      "abstract": "The integration of Artificial Intelligence (AI) into supply chain management has emerged as a pivotal avenue for enhancing efficiency and resilience in contemporary business operations. This paper explores various theoretical approaches to AI within the context of supply chain optimization, delineating pathways to achieve heightened performance and adaptability. Commencing with a historical overview, the paper delves into the evolution of AI techniques in supply chain management, elucidating how these methodologies have transformed the landscape of logistics and operations. Fundamental to this exploration is the discussion on mathematical modeling and algorithmic frameworks that underpin supply chain optimization, providing the theoretical foundation for subsequent AI applications. A key focus of the paper lies in the application of machine learning techniques for demand forecasting and inventory management, which leverage data-driven insights to optimize resource allocation and mitigate risks associated with supply-demand fluctuations. Additionally, network theory and graph algorithms play a crucial role in optimizing the structure and dynamics of supply chain networks, enabling efficient transportation, distribution, and inventory routing. Strategic decision-making in supply chains is addressed through the lens of game theory, which offers theoretical frameworks to model interactions among multiple stakeholders and optimize outcomes in competitive environments. Moreover, swarm intelligence and multi-agent systems provide innovative solutions for coordination and collaboration within complex supply chain ecosystems. Evolutionary algorithms and artificial neural networks are discussed as powerful tools for supply chain design, predictive analytics, and risk management, offering capabilities for optimizing decision-making processes across various operational domains. Furthermore, reinforcement learning techniques empower dynamic decision-making in real-time operational settings, fostering adaptive and resilient supply chain management practices. By integrating multiple AI techniques, hybrid approaches offer synergistic solutions that capitalize on the strengths of diverse methodologies to address multifaceted challenges in supply chain optimization. Through a synthesis of theoretical insights and practical case studies, this paper provides valuable insights into the current state and future directions of AI-driven supply chain optimization.",

      "abstract": "Constrained multi-objective optimization problems (CMOPs) have multiple objective functions that need to be optimized and constraints need to be satisfied, making them difficult to solve. Based on the multitasking optimization, the optimization of the original CMOP can be transformed into multiple related sub-tasks. Existing multitasking-based constrained multi-objective optimization evolutionary algorithms assist the evolution of the original problem by adopting auxiliary tasks. However, this approach may waste computational resources on tasks that are unsuitable for evolutionary states and dynamics. In this paper, a new competitive multitasking-based framework is proposed for CMOPs. We maintain an archive for the constrained Pareto front and multiple sub-tasks as auxiliaries. In each iteration, one of the sub-tasks is selected as the main task, and offspring are generated from its evolution. The offspring are viewed as knowledge and fed back to auxiliary tasks. The reward is mapped to a selection probability to control the main task selection in each iteration. Computational resources are saved by allocating only to the main task that is better suited for different evolutionary stages of different problems. The effectiveness of our approach is validated through experiments on four CMOP benchmark suites compared to eleven state-of-the-art methods.",

A collaborative neural solution that fuses the advantages of evolutionary computation and neural dynamics methods is proposed, which follows a meta-heuristic rule and exploits the robust gradient-based neural solution to deal with different noises. The gradient-based neural solution with robustness (GNSR) is proven to converge with the disturbance of noises and experts in local search. Besides, theoretical analysis ensures that the meta-heuristic rule guarantees the optimal solution for the global search with probability one. Lastly, simulative comparisons with existing methods and an application to manipulability optimization on a redundant manipulator substantiate the superiority of the proposed collaborative neural solution in solving the nonconvex time-varying optimization problems.",

      "abstract": "Many countries in the world have pledged to achieve net-zero emissions goals, implementing a range of relevant policies. As the key implementers in these initiatives, the collaboration between government and enterprise is crucial for the realization of net-zero emissions goals and better sustainable environment. However, the heterogeneous interests of these stakeholders often lead to a game. This research constructs an evolutionary game model to analyze the interactions between government and enterprises, utilizing field studies from China and extensive literature review, to illustrate the behavioral strategies and game dynamics of the two parties. The results show that optimal outcomes are achieved when the government effectively engages enterprises, who in turn actively participate in these initiatives. In addition, this study explores how adjusting game parameters, optimizing the distribution of costs and benefits, and establishing incentive-compatible mechanisms can align the strategic behaviors of both parties towards a more stable equilibrium. This approach facilitates a more organic collaborative governance for better sustainable environment, which has proved fundamental for the robust implementation of net-zero emissions policies. The insights provided in this research broaden the theoretical boundaries of climate governance and policy implementation, providing practical guidelines for policy implementers engaged in net-zero emissions and sustainable environment.",

Still, its relevance is questioned because of evolving consumer behavior, demographics and technology. Contrary to a research paper or systematic literature review, the purpose of this critical reflection paper is to discuss TAM's relevance and limitations in hospitality and tourism research. Design/methodology/approach This paper uses a critical reflective approach, enabling a comprehensive review and synthesis of recent academic literature on TAM. The critical evaluation encompasses its historical trajectory, evolutionary growth, identified limitations and, more specifically, its relevance in the context of hospitality and tourism research. Findings TAM's limitations within the hospitality and tourism context revolve around its individual-centric perspective, limited scope, static nature, cultural applicability and reliance on self-reported measures. Research limitations/implications To optimize TAM's efficacy, the authors propose several strategic recommendations. These include embedding TAM within the specific context of the industry, delving into TAM-driven artificial intelligence adoption, integrating industry-specific factors, acknowledging cultural nuances and using comprehensive research methods, such as mixed methods approach. It is imperative for researchers to critically assess TAM's suitability for their studies and be open to exploring alternative models or methods that can adeptly navigate the distinctive dynamics of the industry. Originality/value This critical reflection paper prompts a profound exploration of technology adoption within the dynamic hospitality and tourism sector, makes insightful inquiries into TAM's future potential and presents recommendations.",

The proposed article presents a robust hybrid algorithm that combines leader-based optimization and Adaptive Differential Evolution (DE) in the framework of the Energy Efficient Hybrid Evolutionary Algorithm (EEHEA), which is specifically designed for the complex environment of IoE-enabled 6G networks. The scheme EEHEA combines the efficacy of leader-based optimization (LBO) for an effective decision-making process and adaptive differential evolutionary optimization (ADE)&#x2019;s dynamic network-parameters adaptation, enhanced convergence, and global searching ability, persistently fine-tuning optimization strategies based on the dynamics of the network. Combining these components into the scheme EEHEA allows it to balance local exploitation and global exploration effectively. This implies better resource allocation and improved energy efficiency in ecosystems with IoE-driven 6G (IoE-6G). The outcomes report that the scheme EEHEA can address the rising energy consumption issues and enhance the efficiency of IoE-6G. Based on simulation experiments, the proposed scheme EEHEA can demonstrate faster convergence times, higher accuracy, and superior flexibility concerning changing network conditions. Its capability to handle energy-related challenges and navigate complex network environments with resilience shows the ability to enhance the performance of IoE-6G. The EEHEA scheme reports its efficacy over state-of-the-art schemes regarding localization, latency, coverage, and energy expenditure performance metrics.",

      "title": "Enhancing cooperative evolution in spatial public goods game by particle swarm optimization based on exploration and q-learning",
      "abstract": "In evolutionary game theory, the emergence and maintenance of cooperative behavior in a population often face challenges posed by the temptation of free-riding behavior, which offers high individual payoff. Recently, apart from a range of mechanisms that promote the formation of cooperation, individual learning abilities under limited information have emerged as a key factor in adjusting agents' strategies. This paper introduces q-learning and particle swarm optimization into the realm of evolutionary dynamics. The primary focus is on investigating the impact of Exploration-based Particle Swarm Optimization (EPSO) and Q-learning-based Particle Swarm Optimization (QPSO) on the evolution of cooperation in a continuous version of the spatial public goods game (SPGG) with punishment. EPSO defines a rule for updating agents' strategies based on individual and limited population information. It also integrates an exploration mechanism to increase the diversity and directionality of the strategies. Additionally, QPSO serves to adaptively optimize the parameters of EPSO, addressing the issue of parameter control limiting the EPSO's performance. Leveraging experiential learning and iterative adjustment, QPSO progressively refines system parameters, thus rationally assimilating knowledge and updating individual strategies to attain optimal payoff. Through extensive simulation studies, it has been observed that employing QPSO's adaptively optimized parameters in EPSO significantly promotes the cooperative evolution in the SPGG with punishment. Furthermore, individual learning coefficients, when too low or too high, both facilitate the occurrence of cooperation. Simultaneously, higher inertia weight coefficients strengthen the system's cooperation level, while lower punishment intensity coefficients and higher gain intensity coefficients effectively promote the cooperation emergence and exert a significant influence on the overall cooperation level of the system. This research provides a new perspective for designing real-world schemes that encourage cooperation and offers insights into the intricate dynamics of cooperation in complex systems.",

      "abstract": "Abstract Evolutionary game dynamics on networks typically consider the competition among simple strategies such as cooperation and defection in the Prisoner\u2019s Dilemma and summarize the effect of population structure as network reciprocity. However, it remains largely unknown regarding the evolutionary dynamics involving multiple powerful strategies typically considered in repeated games, such as the zero-determinant (ZD) strategies that are able to enforce a linear payoff relationship between them and their co-players. Here, we consider the evolutionary dynamics of always cooperate (AllC), extortionate ZD (extortioners), and unbending players in lattice populations based on the commonly used death-birth updating. Out of the class of unbending strategies that can foster reciprocal cooperation and fairness among extortionate players, we consider a particular candidate, pre-optimized through the machine-learning method of particle swarm optimization (PSO), called PSO Gambler. We derive analytical results under weak selection and rare mutations, including pairwise fixation probabilities and long-term frequencies of strategies. In the absence of the third unbending type, extortioners can achieve a half-half split in equilibrium with unconditional cooperators for sufficiently large extortion factors. However, the presence of unbending players fundamentally changes the dynamics and tilts the system to favor unbending cooperation. Most surprisingly, extortioners cannot dominate at all regardless of how large their extortion factor is, and the long-term frequency of unbending players is maintained almost as a constant. Our analytical method is applicable to studying the evolutionary dynamics of multiple strategies in structured populations. Our work provides insights into the interplay between network reciprocity and direct reciprocity, revealing the role of unbending strategies in enforcing fairness and suppressing extortion.",

First, the concept of spatial SD is presented to comprehensively evaluate the similarity of individual solutions from two aspects of distance and angle, and the individual information between two adjacent generations is used to enhance the diversity of individuals and accelerate the convergence of the algorithm. Second, aiming at the complex multiconstraint during the operation optimization of WWTP, an adaptive penalty algorithm is further adopted to punish the individual solutions that violate the constraints, so as to improve the handling efficiency and success rate of constraints. Furthermore, in view of the time-varying dynamics of actual WWTP, a recursive bilinear subspace identification method based on sliding window is adopted to establish the optimization models as well as the constraint models with self-learning parameter, which provides accurate model guarantee for high-performance multiobjective operation optimization. Finally, the effectiveness, superiority, and practicability of the proposed method are verified through test function experiments as well as operation optimization control experiments of WWTP.",

      "abstract": "Dynamic environments pose great challenges for expensive optimization problems, as the objective functions of these problems change over time and thus require remarkable computational resources to track the optimal solutions. Although data-driven evolutionary optimization and Bayesian optimization (BO) approaches have shown promise in solving expensive optimization problems in static environments, the attempts to develop such approaches in dynamic environments remain rarely explored. In this article, we propose a simple yet effective meta-learning-based optimization framework for solving the expensive dynamic optimization problems. This framework is flexible, allowing any off-the-shelf continuously differentiable surrogate model to be used in a plug-in manner, either in data-driven evolutionary optimization or BO approaches. In particular, the framework consists of two unique components: 1) the meta-learning component, in which a gradient-based meta-learning approach is adopted to learn experience (effective model parameters) across different dynamics along the optimization process and 2) the adaptation component, where the learned experience (model parameters) is used as the initial parameters for fast adaptation in the dynamic environment based on few shot samples. By doing so, the optimization process is able to quickly initiate the search in a new environment within a strictly restricted computational budget. Experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm framework compared to several state-of-the-art algorithms on common benchmark test problems under different dynamic characteristics.",

Understanding its molecular intricacies is essential for both academic inquiry and potential biomedical applications. This study introduces an advanced single-molecule surface-enhanced Raman scattering (SM-SERS) system based on DNA origami nanoantennas (DONAs), optimized to provide unparalleled insights into protein structure and interactions. Our system effectively detects shifts in the Amide III band, thereby elucidating protein dynamics and conformational changes. Additionally, the system permits concurrent observations of oxidation processes and Amide bands, offering an integrated view of protein structural and chemical modifications. Notably, our approach diverges from traditional SM-SERS techniques by de-emphasizing resonance conditions for SERS excitation, aiming to mitigate challenges like peak oversaturation. Our findings underscore the capability of our DONAs to illuminate single-molecule behaviors, even within aggregate systems, providing clarity on molecular interactions and behaviors.",

      "abstract": "Many aerodynamic shape optimization methods often focus on utilizing the end-to-end relationship between design variables and aerodynamic performance to find the optimal design, while overlooking the exploration of geometric knowledge of the shape itself. To fully use geometric knowledge to improve optimization efficiency, this paper proposes an efficient method by exploring the potential correlation between geometric features and aerodynamic performance at a low cost. We use unsupervised isometric feature mapping in manifold learning to capture geometric features that can distinguish the aerodynamic performance of different airfoils without embedding any tags. Then a filter criterion is establish based on the geometric features. During the optimization process, airfoils that deliver poor aerodynamic performance can be filtered out with a high probability before being precisely evaluated through computational fluid dynamics simulations. This helps improve samples quality to enhance the optimization efficiency. We applied the proposed method to the unconstrained and constrained optimizations of the Royal Aircraft Establishment (RAE) 2822 airfoil to validate its performance. The results demonstrate that the proposed method can improve the efficiency of optimization by over 50% compared with the original evolutionary optimization algorithm. It performs well across various optimization problems, demonstrating high engineering practical value.",

      "abstract": "Antimicrobial resistance was estimated to be associated with 4.95 million deaths worldwide in 2019. It is possible to frame the antimicrobial resistance problem as a feedback-control problem. If we could optimize this feedback-control problem and translate our findings to the clinic, we could slow, prevent, or reverse the development of high-level drug resistance. Prior work on this topic has relied on systems where the exact dynamics and parameters were known a priori. In this study, we extend this work using a reinforcement learning (RL) approach capable of learning effective drug cycling policies in a system defined by empirically measured fitness landscapes. Crucially, we show that it is possible to learn effective drug cycling policies despite the problems of noisy, limited, or delayed measurement. Given access to a panel of 15 <mml:math xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" display=\"inline\" overflow=\"scroll\"> <mml:mi>\u03b2</mml:mi> </mml:math> -lactam antibiotics with which to treat the simulated Escherichia coli population, we demonstrate that RL agents outperform two naive treatment paradigms at minimizing the population fitness over time. We also show that RL agents approach the performance of the optimal drug cycling policy. Even when stochastic noise is introduced to the measurements of population fitness, we show that RL agents are capable of maintaining evolving populations at lower growth rates compared to controls. We further tested our approach in arbitrary fitness landscapes of up to 1,024 genotypes. We show that minimization of population fitness using drug cycles is not limited by increasing genome size. Our work represents a proof-of-concept for using AI to control complex evolutionary processes.",

This paper aims to optimize the strategy game with general information delays, including the state delay in the previous work, and the control delay that is introduced for the first time to depict the time consumed by strategy propagation in reality. Specifically, the dynamics of networked evolutionary games is transformed into an algebraic form by use of the newly proposed semi-tensor product of matrices, which extends the ordinary matrix multiplication. Subsequently, according to the values of control and state delays, the strategy optimization problem can be divided into six different cases, and then via the constructed algebraic equation, we can obtain the sufficient and necessary conditions for the existence of the strategy optimization. Meanwhile, based on a reachable set method, the corresponding feedback controllers are further designed. Last, one illustrative example is taken to demonstrate the feasibility of our model. The results of this paper will be helpful to investigate the game-based control issues in the complex networked environment.",

      "abstract": "The built environment faces significant challenges in managing energy demands amidst rising temperatures and increasing concerns linked to climate change. Meeting carbon emissions targets and resource management goals necessitates urgent innovation in more energy-efficient cooling solutions. Nature offers a large database of adaptive and efficient thermal solutions that can be harnessed through biomimetic methods in building design and systems. Emerging biomimetic and computational approaches hold promise in facilitating practical application efforts. This paper investigates the translation of morphological features from elephant skin to building facades, optimizing their inherent cooling capabilities through computational design using evolutionary algorithms. Through this exploration, we propose a set of generalized evolutionary principles, offering a foundational framework for the development of textured facade tiles with the aim of mitigating heat gain from solar radiation. This study provides an in-depth analysis of how assembly, texture depth, and orientation impact thermal performance, enabling the design of more effective passive cooling systems through an understanding of the relationship between morphological variations in textured surfaces and environmental performance. Future research may involve studying natural convection dynamics, optimizing capillary networks, evaluating materials for water adhesion and cleaning, assessing impacts on biological growth, and exploring biodiversity integration within textured facade panels.",

      "abstract": "Codon usage bias refers to the preferential use of synonymous codons, a widespread phenomenon found in bacteria, plants, and animals. Codon bias varies among species, families, and groups within kingdoms and between genes within an organism. Codon usage bias (CUB) analysis sheds light on the evolutionary dynamics of various species and optimizes targeted gene expression in heterologous host plants. As a significant order of gymnosperms, species within Gnetales possess extremely high ecological and pharmaceutical values. However, comprehensive analyses of CUB within the chloroplast genomes of Gnetales species remain unexplored. A systematic analysis was conducted to elucidate the codon usage patterns in 13 diverse Gnetales species based on the chloroplast genomes. Our results revealed that chloroplast coding sequences (cp CDSs) in 13 Gnetales species display a marked preference for AT bases and A/T-ending codons. A total of 20 predominantly high-frequency codons and between 2 and 7 optimal codons were identified across these species. The findings from the ENC-plot, PR2-plot, and neutrality analyses suggested that both mutation pressure and natural selection exert influence on the codon bias in these 13 Gnetales species, with natural selection emerging as the predominant influence. Correspondence analysis (COA) demonstrated variation in the codon usage patterns among the Gnetales species and indicated mutation pressure is another factor that could impact CUB. Additionally, our research identified a positive correlation between the measure of idiosyncratic codon usage level of conservatism (MILC) and synonymous codon usage order (SCUO) values, indicative of CUB\u2019s potential influence on gene expression. The comparative analysis concerning codon usage frequencies among the 13 Gnetales species and 4 model organisms revealed that Saccharomyces cerevisiae and Nicotiana tabacum were the optimal exogenous expression hosts. Furthermore, the cluster and phylogenetic analyses illustrated distinct patterns of differentiation, implying that codons, even with weak or neutral preferences, could affect the evolutionary trajectories of these species. Our results reveal the characteristics of codon usage patterns and contribute to an enhanced comprehension of evolutionary mechanisms in Gnetales species.",

Through the numerical simulation and analysis, the different mode-locked pulses\u2019 (such as single pulses, bound-state pulses, and chaotic multi-pulses) regime transformation conditions are quantified. The results suggest that with an increase in the pump strength, the sub-pulse energy and output coupler of the Mamyshev oscillator show an inverse proportion trend, which plays an important role in increasing the number of sub-pulses in the bound-state pulses\u2019 state. Furthermore, optimization schemes, such as adjusting the filter bandwidth and slowing down the accumulation of nonlinear effects, are proposed to achieve a high-energy pulse output in the Mamyshev oscillator.",

However, this procedure has drawbacks such as high cost, time consumption, and limited patient exploration of treatment regimens. We develop a multi-objective optimization-based framework to address these limitations and determine the best chemotherapy dosing and treatment duration. The proposed framework uses patient-specific biological parameters to create a mathematical model of cell population dynamics in the patient\u2019s body. The framework employs evolutionary heuristic search methods (simulated annealing and genetic algorithms) and a prescriptive analytics approach to optimize therapy sessions that transition from treatment to relaxation. We carefully adjust the chemotherapy dose during treatment to reduce tumor cells while preserving host cells (such as effector-immune cells). We strategically time the relaxation sessions to aid recovery, considering the ability of tumors and healthy cells to regenerate. We use a combined optimization method to determine the length of the session and the amount of drug to be administered. We compare quadratic and linear optimal control solvers for drug administration while genetic algorithms and simulated annealing are used to optimize session length. This approach is especially important in limited healthcare resources, ensuring efficient allocation while accurately identifying high-risk patients to optimize resource allocation and utilization.",

      "abstract": "The optomechanical cavity system has been a paradigm in the manifestation of continuous variable quantum information over the past decade. This paper investigates how quantum phase synchronization is associated with bipartite Gaussian entanglement in coupled gain-loss mechanical oscillators, where the gain and loss rates can be controlled by driving the cavities with blue and red detuned lasers, respectively. We examine the role of the exceptional point (EP) in a deterministic way of producing self-sustained oscillations that generate robust quantum correlations among quadrature fluctuations of the mechanical oscillators. Particularly, steady phase synchronization dynamics along with the entanglement phenomena are observed in the effective weak-coupling regime above a critical driving power. These phenomena are further verified by observing the mechanical squeezing and phase-space rotations of the Wigner distributions. Moreover, the fidelity fluctuation shows how the quantum correlation dynamics are related to the EP of the system. We also discuss the impact of the mechanical oscillator's frequency mismatch and decoherence due to thermal phonons on system dynamics. These findings hold promise for applications in phonon-based quantum communication and information processing on the macroscopic scale.",

      "abstract": "The time-dependent process whereby one-dimensional systems of self-sustained oscillators synchronize is shown to display scale invariance in space and time, akin to that found in the dynamics of equilibrium critical phenomena. Remarkably, the process is largely independent of system details, sharing with a class of nonequilibrium surface kinetic roughening the universal scaling behavior of the Kardar-Parisi-Zhang equation with columnar noise, and featuring phase fluctuations that follow a Tracy-Widom probability distribution. This is revealed by a numerical exploration of rings of Stuart-Landau oscillators (the universal representation of an oscillating system close to a Hopf bifurcation) and rings of van der Pol oscillators, both paradigmatically supporting self-sustained oscillations. The critical behavior is very well-defined for limit-cycle oscillations near bifurcation, and still dominates comparatively far from it. In particular, the Tracy-Widom fluctuation distribution seems to be an extremely robust feature of the synchronization process. The nonequilibrium criticality here described appears to transcend the details of the coupled dynamical systems that synchronize, making plausible its experimental observation.

The time evolution of this game is described by a two\u2010dimensional noninvertible discrete time map using the bounded rationality mechanism. For this map, some dynamic characteristics such as multistability and synchronization are investigated. Its equilibrium points are obtained for the asymmetric case, and their conditions of stability are obtained. Our results investigate that the Nash equilibrium point may be unstable due to flip bifurcation and under certain parameter values, and Neimark\u2013Sacker bifurcation is born after the period\u20104 cycle. Through some restrictions, the coordinate axes of the map construct an invariant manifold, and therefore, their dynamics can be analyzed by using a one\u2010dimensional map. In the symmetric case, both firms behave identically, and this implies that the diagonal set forms an invariant manifold, and hence the synchronization phenomena take place. Furthermore, the global bifurcation of the map is confirmed through contact between critical curves and the boundaries of infeasible domains.",

This establishes a powerful paradigm for investigating non-equilibrium order formation, yet the fundamental mechanisms of critical-point synchronization remain poorly understood. Here, we utilize a microwave pulse as a seed to induce quantum synchronization at the critical point of Floquet driven Rydberg atoms. In the experiment, the microwave periodic driving on Rydberg states acts as a seeded temporal order in subspace, which triggers synchronization across the entire ensemble. The behavior of the emergent synchronized oscillation is elaborately linked to alterations in the seed, such as the relative phase shift and the frequency difference, which result in phase-dependent seeding and embryonic synchronization. This result opens up new possibilities for studying and harnessing time-dependent quantum many-body phenomena, offering insight into the behavior of complex many-body systems under seeding.",

      "abstract": "Synchronization is one of the emerging collective phenomena in interacting particle systems. Its ubiquitous presence in nature, science, and technology has fascinated the scientific community over the decades. Moreover, a great deal of research has been, and is still being, devoted to understand various physical aspects of the subject. In particular, the study of interacting active particles has led to exotic phase transitions in such systems which have opened up a new research front-line. Motivated by this line of work, in this paper, we study the directional synchrony among self-propelled particles. These particles move inside a bounded region, and crucially their directions are also coupled with spatial degrees of freedom. We assume that the directional coupling between two particles is influenced by the relative spatial distance which changes over time. Furthermore, the nature of the influence is considered to be both short and long-ranged. We explore the phase transition scenario in both the cases and propose an approximation technique which enables us to analytically find the critical transition point. The results are further supported with numerical simulations. Our results have potential importance in the study of active systems like bird flocks, fish schools, and swarming robots where spatial influence plays a pertinent role.",

      "abstract": "Coupled oscillators with time-delayed network interactions are critical to understand synchronization phenomena in many physical systems. Phase reductions to finite-dimensional phase oscillator networks allow for their explicit analysis. However, first-order phase reductions - where delays correspond to phase lags - fail to capture the delay-dependence of synchronization. We develop a systematic approach to derive phase reductions for delay-coupled oscillators to arbitrary order. Already the second-order reduction can predict delay-dependent (bi-)stability of synchronized states as demonstrated for Stuart-Landau oscillators.",

      "abstract": "Abstract In this work, a large-scale mockup of a compact complex system integrating a steam generator (SG) and a reactor coolant pump (RCP) is considered. The three-dimensional turbulent flow in the steam generator channel head (SGCH) is measured in detail. Dual-orthogonal-plane particle image velocimetry (PIV) is employed to extract high-resolution flow information in two orthogonal planes. Two separate measurements are first made to see the three-dimensional time-mean flow dynamics and the statistical quantities in the two planes. These measurements highlight two distinct flow phenomena: jet arrays and massive turbulent separation bubbles (TSBs). These patterns are attributed to mass flow redistribution in the U-shaped tubes. Proper orthogonal decomposition (POD) identifies the first POD mode as corresponding to the TSB breathing-like motion, which significantly intensifies the side view streamwise velocity fluctuations, leading to them reaching 370% of the local mean velocity. To examine the unsteady behavior of massively separated regions, the dual-orthogonal-plane PIV system is then synchronized to simultaneously measure variations in the flow fields, and the missing data due to illumination interference are reconstructed using gappy POD. The synchronized analysis reveals a direct relationship between the low-frequency fluctuations in the side and front views. These fluctuations are in phase across both views, indicating a synchronized behavior that spans the entire field. This large-scale low-frequency breathing motion has critical implications for numerical simulations and sheds light on the unsteady behavior of the RCP system within the SGCH.",

Real-time monitoring techniques play an important role in understanding critical physical phenomena, namely, melt pool dynamics and defect formation, during the manufacturing of components. This review aims to explore the integration of acoustic measurement techniques with X-ray imaging for studying these physical phenomena in laser manufacturing. A key aspect emphasized in this work is the importance of time synchronization for real-time observation using multiple sensors. X-ray imaging has proven to be a powerful tool for observing the dynamics of the melt pools and the formation of defects in real time. However, X-ray imaging has limitations in terms of accessibility which can be overcome through combination with other more-accessible measurement methods, such as acoustic emission spectroscopy. Furthermore, this combination simplifies the interpretation of acoustic data, which can be complex in its own right. This combined approach, which has evolved in recent years, presents a promising strategy for understanding acoustic emission signals during laser processing. This work provides a comprehensive review of existing research efforts in this area.",

      "abstract": "Molecular dynamics simulations are utilized to unravel the temperature-driven phase transition in double-layered butylammonium (BA) methylammonium (MA) lead halide perovskite (BA)<sub>2</sub>(MA)Pb<sub>2</sub>I<sub>7</sub>, which holds great promise for a wide range of optoelectronics and sensor applications. The simulations successfully capture the structural transition from low to high symmetry phases with rising temperatures, consistent with experimental observations. The phase transition is initiated at two critical interfaces: the first is between the inorganic and organic layers, where the melting of N-H bonds in BA leads to a significant reduction in hydrogen bonding between BA and iodides, and the second is at the interface between the top and bottom organic layers, where the melting of the tail bonds in BA triggers the phase transition. Following this, BA cations exhibit a patterned and synchronized motion reminiscent of a conical pendulum, displaying a mix of ordered and disordered behaviors prior to evolving into a completely molten and disordered state. While the melting of BA cations is the primary driver of the phase transition, the rotational dynamics of MA cations also plays a critical role in determining the phase transition temperature, influenced by the BA-MA interaction. Such an interaction alters the polarization patterns of MA cations across the phase transition. In particular, an antiparallel polarization pattern is observed in the low-temperature phase. Additionally, displacive elements of the phase transition are identified in the simulations, characterized by the shear and distortion of the inorganic octahedra. Notably, at lower temperatures, the octahedral distortion follows a bimodal distribution, reflecting significant variations in distortion among octahedra. This variation is attributed to an anisotropic hydrogen bonding network between iodides and BA cations. Our study reveals the phenomena and mechanisms extending beyond the order-disorder transition mechanism, suggesting potential phase engineering through strategic tuning of organic and inorganic components.",

Here we show that monolayered NbTe2 serves as an ideal platform where lattice, charge, and spin degrees of freedom manifest cooperatively, leading to a new and threading order of chirality. By using spin-polarized scanning tunneling microscopy/spectroscopy, we reveal that the root19 * root19 phase of NbTe2 is encoded with both alternating-chiral atomic displacements and charge density waves, characterized by two chiral units of opposite handedness within the reconstructed cell. We show unambiguous evidence for emergent spin polarizations spreading over the primitive cell, with the magnetization orientation synchronized with alternating handedness of chiral order. Our first-principles studies identify the origin of intertwined orders being correlation driven, with the threading order of chirality emerging when the on-site Coulomb repulsion exceeds a critical value. The spin ordering is further shown to be of hybrid ferrimagnetic nature, contributed by the itinerant electrons and localized d-orbitals. Collectively, these findings expand the realm of chiral order in correlated electron systems, and facilitate an appealing platform for chiral spintronic and related applications.",

      "title": "Experiments on Structurally Mistuned UHBR Open-Test-Case Fan ECL5/CATANA",
      "abstract": "Abstract The operational capabilities of turbofan engines encounter limitations due to instabilities arising from tightly coupled interactions among aerodynamics, acoustics, and structural mechanics. Modern fans and compressors exhibit Non-Synchronous Vibration (NSV), leading to safety-critical blade oscillations. In contrast to self-excited phenomena such as flutter, NSV stems from the convection of aerodynamic disturbances that synchronize with blade eigenmodes. Understanding this phenomenon is challenging, as its intricate interaction patterns and the occurrence of flow separations constrain the predictive capabilities of current state-of-the-art methods. To establish a comprehensive benchmark dataset on the aeroelastic behavior of modern Ultra-High Bypass Ratio (UHBR) architectures, the European CleanSky-2 project CATANA aimed to examine a carbon composite fan stage, ECL5, utilizing multiphysical instrumentation. Recently, experiments on a structurally tuned reference configuration were conducted, revealing highamplitude Non-Synchronous Vibration (NSV) at multiple subsonic speedlines. The observed interaction modes and instability onset differed significantly from numerical predictions using both LRANS and URANS with prescribed harmonic blade motion. In an effort to enhance the dataset, two additional fan configurations with identical blade profile geometries were investigated: one featured a structurally mistuned rotor with approximately doubled frequency variation of all eigenmodes compared to the reference, and the other involved a case with locally increased tip clearance on individual blades. This paper presents the experimental results of a sensitivity study and explores the influence of structural mistuning and tip clearance variation associated with manufacturing tolerances. Contrary to the intended outcome, it will be demonstrated that the mistuned case exhibited higher blade vibration amplitudes than the reference case during NSV. Detailed instrumentation reveals that the mistuning pattern was effectively transferred to the rotating system, but aerodynamic mistuning, particularly concerning tip clearance, emerged as a dominant factor. The non-synchronous forced-response nature of NSV during highly throttled operation ultimately dictates the observed response levels under different conditions, necessitating a thorough analysis to evaluate the robustness of a specific configuration. These results contribute valuable insights to the open dataset for the ECL5 configuration, benefiting the research community. Particularly noteworthy is the detailed capture of blade-to-blade variations in this research, which will prove instrumental in validating numerical methods.",

      "abstract": "ABSTRACT Motor resonance \u2013 the activation of the observer\u2019s motor system when viewing others\u2019 actions \u2013 grounds the intertwined nature of action perception and execution, with profound implications for social cognition and action understanding. Despite extensive research, the neural underpinnings supporting motor resonance emergence and rewriting remain unexplored. In this study, we investigated the role of sensorimotor associative learning in motor resonance neural mechanisms. To this aim, we applied cross-systems paired associative stimulation (PAS) to induce novel visuomotor associations in the human brain. This protocol, which repeatedly pairs transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) pulses over the primary motor cortex (M1) with visual stimuli of actions, drives the emergence of an atypical, PAS-conditioned motor resonance response. Using TMS and electroencephalography (EEG) co-registration during action observation, we tracked the M1 functional connectivity profile during this process to map the inter-areal connectivity profiles associated with typical and PAS-induced motor resonance phenomena. Besides confirming, at the corticospinal level, the emergence of newly acquired motor resonance responses at the cost of typical ones after PAS administration, our results reveal dissociable aspects of motor resonance in M1 interregional communication. On the one side, typical motor resonance effects acquired through the lifespan are associated with prominent M1 alpha-band and reduced beta-band connectivity, which might facilitate the corticospinal output while integrating visuomotor information. Conversely, the atypical PAS-induced motor resonance is linked to M1 beta-band cortical connectivity modulations, only partially overlapping with interregional communication patterns related to the typical mirroring responses. This evidence suggests that beta-phase synchronization may be the critical mechanism supporting the formation of motor resonance by coordinating the activity of motor regions during action observation, which also involves alpha-band top-down control of frontal areas. These findings provide new insights into the neural dynamics underlying (typical and newly acquired) motor resonance, highlighting the role of large-scale interregional communication in sensorimotor associative learning within the action observation network.",

      "abstract": "Protein post-translational modification (PTM) site prediction is a fundamental task in bioinformatics. Several computational methods have been developed to predict PTM sites. However, existing methods ignore the structure information and merely utilize protein sequences. Furthermore, designing a more fine-grained structure representation learning method is urgently needed as PTM is a biological event that occurs at the atom granularity. In this paper, we propose a PTM site prediction method by Coupling of Multi-Granularity structure and Multi-Scale sequence representation, PTM-CMGMS for brevity. Specifically, multigranularity structure-aware representation learning is designed to learn neighborhood structure representations at the amino acid, atom, and whole protein granularity from AlphaFold predicted structures, followed by utilizing contrastive learning to optimize the structure representations. Additionally, multi-scale sequence representation learning is used to extract context sequence information, and motif generated by aligning all context sequences of PTM sites assists the prediction. Extensive experiments on three datasets show that PTM-CMGMS outperforms the state-of-the-art methods. Source code can be found at https://github.com/LZY-HZAU/PTM-CMGMS.",

      "abstract": "The development and utilization of urban underground space represents a crucial strategy for achieving sustainable urban development. Three-dimensional (3D) geological models provide a data foundation and technical support for research in urban planning and construction, as well as the prevention and control of environmental geological issues. However, current urban 3D geological modeling generally faces the challenge of multi-source heterogeneous modeling data. This often necessitates varying degrees of generalization in data processing, resulting in the majority of current urban 3D geological models being relatively coarse and insufficient to fulfill the demand for detailed geological information in contemporary urban development and management. Therefore, determining how to formulate or optimize the 3D geological modeling schemes to enhance the utilization of multi-source heterogeneous data is a key challenge in current urban 3D geological modeling. This study, taking the 3D geological structure modeling of Wuhan\u2019s metropolitan development area (MDA) as an example, develops an automated scheme for standardizing modeling data based on multi-scale geological chronostratigraphy. By utilizing the standardized stratigraphy as a unified and independent geological framework for layered modeling, a high-precision 3D geological model of Wuhan\u2019s MDA, characterized by large-scale and ultra-complex geological conditions, is constructed through a methodology that integrates the global discrete constrained points modeling approach with the global layered modeling approach, without generalizing the multi-source heterogeneous modeling data. This research not only holds significant practical implications for the prevention and control of comprehensive urban geological issues in Wuhan but also provides novel technical insights into the methodology of 3D urban geological modeling.",

The coupling scheme involves formulating a single pressure matrix for the CUPID and SPACE coupled domain, which is then divided into two submatrices to solve each computing domain separately. The coupling scheme was verified using theoretical problems of vertical pipes and an elliptical manometer tube. The verification results demonstrate that the CUPID/SPACE code successfully simulates various scenarios in a reactor safety analysis, considering various coupling directions and working fluids such as gas, liquid, two-phase, and incompressible gas. The CUPID/SPACE code was validated by simulating the ROCOM test 1\u20131, where the CUPID code calculated the ROCOM vessel and the SPACE code simulated the remaining components including pipes, pumps, and valves. The simulation results of ROCOM test 1.1 using the CUPID/SPACE code indicate its successful application in reactor safety analysis.",

Demand response has great potential to tackle those issues, particularly with thermal loads due to the thermal inertia of buildings and heat storage systems. Residential buildings are currently heated through different energy carriers, such as gas, electricity, and district heating, with each building usually having its own heating system. However, there is the possibility to connect neighboring buildings through hot water connections. The improvement of the system's flexibility by such micro-scale multi-energy coupling is analyzed using a model predictive control approach for the operation of the buildings and the concept of flexibility envelopes.",

      "abstract": "Abstract The use of irregular pore\u2010scale models to study heavy oil reservoirs with high\u2010temperature, high\u2010pressure, and high\u2010stress characteristics is effective. Previous studies have typically focused on regular models and conventional environmental reservoirs, with limited exploration of irregular models and reservoirs in extreme environments. In investigating the process of water displacing heavy oil within reservoirs under high\u2010temperature, high\u2010pressure, and high\u2010stress conditions at the pore scale, the utilization of the four\u2010parameter method creates a micro\u2010scale irregular porous media model. The model systematically considers the variation of physical properties of rocks and heavy oil with temperature. The results indicate that an appropriate increase in water injection rate or a decrease in reservoir contact angle will increase the recovery rate, temperature, and stress of the reservoir. At a displacement time of 0.3 s, with the water injection rate increasing from 0.004 to 0.01 m \u2219 s \u22121 , the reservoir's recovery degree experiences an increase of 0.091. Simultaneously, the average temperature and average stress of the reservoir increase by 29.66 K and 1.9464 \u00d7 10 9 N \u00b7 m \u22122 , respectively. At a displacement time of 0.3 s and with the contact angle decreasing from 2\u03c0/3 to \u03c0/3, the reservoir's recovery degree increases by 0.44537, and the average temperature and average stress of the reservoir increase by 2.87 K and 1.86 \u00d7 10 8 N \u00b7 m \u22122 , respectively.",

Thus, this paper researches the multi-scale oscillation of PSWPCS with surge tanks. Firstly, the mathematical equations of PSWPCS with surge tanks are established. Then, the multi-scale oscillation and effect rules of surge tank area are investigated. Finally, the influence mechanism of multi-scale oscillation is studied. The results indicate that PSWPCS with surge tanks has multi-scale oscillation. The ultra-low frequency damping performance of upstream and downstream surge tanks is stronger than that of single surge tank, and the negative damping characteristics of which changes significantly with the 50% increase of upstream surge tank area. A larger water head of power station and smaller head loss of headrace tunnel are easier to induce the ultra-low frequency oscillation. The pitch angle controller of wind turbine can significantly suppress the low frequency oscillation under larger proportional and smaller integral gain. When proportional and integral gain of phase-locked loop controller are small, the sub-synchronous oscillation will be excited. Smaller stator self-inductance and rotor resistance can improve the system regulation performance.",

      "abstract": "Abstract. The Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) model has been widely used for various applications, especially for solving mesoscale atmospheric dynamics. Its high-order numerical schemes and nesting capability enable high spatial resolution. However, a growing number of applications are demanding more realistic simulations through the incorporation of coupling with new model compartments and an increase in the complexity of the processes considered in the model. (e.g., ocean, surface gravity wave, land-surface, chemistry...). The present paper details the development and the functionalities of the coupling interface we implemented in WRF. It uses the Ocean-Atmosphere-Sea-Ice-Soil \u2013 Model Coupling Toolkit (OASIS3-MCT) coupler, which has the advantage of being non-intrusive, efficient, and very flexible to use. OASIS3-MCT has already been implemented in many climate and regional models. This coupling interface is designed with the following baselines: (1) it is structured with a 2-level design through 2 modules: a general coupling module, and a coupler-specific module, allowing to easily add other couplers if required, (2) variables exchange, coupling frequency, and any potential time and grid transformations are controlled through an external text file, offering great flexibility, (3) the concepts of \u201cexternal domains\u201d and \u201ccoupling mask\u201d are introduced to facilitate the exchange of fields to/from multiple sources (different models, fields from different models/grids/zooms...). Finally, two examples of applications of ocean-atmosphere coupling are proposed. The first is related to the impact of ocean surface current feedback to the atmospheric boundary layer, and the second concerns the coupling of surface gravity waves with the atmospheric surface layer.",

      "abstract": "Abstract We investigate the effect of the electron temperature gradient (ETG) driven turbulence on the energy transport in JT-60U L-mode plasma by means of the multi-scale gyrokinetic simulation. In the core region at <mml:math xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" overflow=\"scroll\"> <mml:mi>r</mml:mi> <mml:mrow> <mml:mo>/</mml:mo> </mml:mrow> <mml:mi>a</mml:mi> <mml:mo>=</mml:mo> <mml:mn>0.5</mml:mn> </mml:math> , the instability in the ion scale is driven by the ion temperature gradient (ITG), meanwhile strong unstable ETG modes are found in the electron scale. The nonlinear multi-scale gyrokinetic simulation shows that ETG modes are stabilized in the nonlinear phase and the energy transport in the multi-scale simulation is similar to that obtained in the ion scale ITG simulation. In an outer region at <mml:math xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" overflow=\"scroll\"> <mml:mi>r</mml:mi> <mml:mrow> <mml:mo>/</mml:mo> </mml:mrow> <mml:mi>a</mml:mi> <mml:mo>=</mml:mo> <mml:mn>0.6</mml:mn> </mml:math> , the ion scale instability changes to be the trapped electron mode (TEM). The multi-scale simulation shows that both the ion and the electron energy flux are reduced by <mml:math xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" overflow=\"scroll\"> <mml:mrow> <mml:mo>\u223c</mml:mo> </mml:mrow> <mml:mn>30</mml:mn> <mml:mi mathvariant=\"normal\">%</mml:mi> </mml:math> compared to those obtained in the single scale TEM simulation. Interestingly, the electron energy flux is close to the experimental value after this reduction. From the data analyses, we find that ETG turbulence damps the energy of TEM modes through the ion scale/electron scale coupling and the electron scale/electron scale coupling, and can be modeled as a turbulent diffusion of TEM modes. These results suggest that the single ion scale simulation seems to be still valid in the inner region with <mml:math xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" overflow=\"scroll\"> <mml:mi>r</mml:mi> <mml:mrow> <mml:mo>/</mml:mo> </mml:mrow> <mml:mi>a</mml:mi> <mml:mo>&lt;</mml:mo> <mml:mn>0.5</mml:mn> </mml:math> . However, in the outer region it is necessary to include the ETG modes in the gyrokinetic simulations to explain the energy transport in this L-mode plasma. This is the first result showing that ETG turbulence can reduce the electron energy loss via the cross-scale interaction in a real tokamak equilibrium profile.",

      "abstract": "Low-intensity pulsed ultrasound stimulation (LIPUS) as a non-invasive, high-spatial resolution and high penetration depth brain modulation technology has been used for modulating neuromuscular function. However, the modulation of neural electrical signal changes in the neuromuscular system by LIPUS remains to be explored. In this study, we stimulated the mouse brain motor cortex by LIPUS with different number of tone burst (NTB) and recorded the local field potential (LFP) signals of the target region and electromyography (EMG) of tail muscle. Multi-Scale Transfer Entropy (MSTE) analysis method was used to explore the multi-scale synchronization characteristics and functional cortico-muscular coupling(FCMC) strength changes of mice LFP-EMG before and after LIPUS under different NTBs. The results show that the MSTE of LFP-EMG before and after LIPUS stimulation was higher than that of EMG-LFP. After adding multi-scale, MSTE has a significant relationship with time scales. When NTB =200, the scale of extremum is the largest. There was a fitting intersection between LFP-EMG and EMG-LFP scale 7-21 before and after stimulation. After scale averaging, the LFP-EMG after stimulation was lower than that before stimulation, and the EMG-LFP after stimulation was higher than that before stimulation. Conclusion: There is a significant correlation between NTB and time scale before and after LIPUS, as well as upward and downward. Consequently, This study used FCMC methods to study different NTBs and multi-scale relationships, provides new variables from LIPUS parameters and analysis, and provides new reference for clinical applications of LIPUS.",

At present, the multi-layer thermal protection structure with ceramic matrix composite (CMC) materials has gradually been applied as the internal resistant layer, due to its high specific strength and high temperature resistance. The mechanical-thermal coupling analysis method for CMC multi-layer thermal protection structures needs to be established, considering the complex distributed thermal and stress loads inside the combustion chambers. Firstly, for the local periodic unit of multilayer thermal protection structure, the mesoscale braided structure model and the homogenized model are constructed respectively, to explore the influence of the braided structure inside CMC layer on the temperature and stress distribution. Then, the macroscale model of the multi-layer CMC thermal protection structure is established, based on the feasibility of the local periodic element model verification method. The mechanical-thermal coupling analysis of the overall multi-layer thermal protection structure is carried out, and the temperature distribution and structural deformation are explored.",

      "abstract": "This study employs polyvinyl alcohol (PVA) fibers and silane coupling agent (SCA) to augment rubberized concrete mechanical prowess. A multiscale investigation delves into the synergistic enhancement mechanism of SCA on the interfaces of PVA/cement and rubber/cement, considering macroscopic mechanical properties, microscopic structural characteristics, and nanoscale interface interactions. Initially, fundamental mechanical performance tests reveal a notable enhancement in compressive and flexural strength with the inclusion of SCA and PVA fibers in rubberized concrete. Subsequently, observations of corresponding composite concrete slices are conducted using scanning electron microscopy (SEM), X-ray diffraction (XRD), and Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR). The results manifest gel and polymer filling interface gaps, with SCA fostering a tighter amalgamation of the two interfaces, effectively rectifying interface defects and elucidating its bonding effects at the microscopic interface. Molecular dynamics (MD) modeling and simulation analyses of PVA/C-S-H and rubber/C-S-H, pre- and post-SCA modification, demonstrate that SCA mitigates interface effects, reinforcing hydrogen bonding, van der Waals interactions, Ca-H coordination bonds, and stability. This augmentation enhances interface adhesion energy, fortifying the weak interface bonding between PVA fibers, rubber, and inorganic silicate (C-S-H). Ultimately, portal frame experiments substantiate that incorporating fiber rubberized concrete into structures not only fails to diminish but marginally enhances the load-bearing capacity of the framework. This research furnishes concrete and innovative solutions for sustainable development while providing a valuable reference for the future application of PVA fiber rubberized concrete materials in practical engineering endeavors.",

      "abstract": "Abstract Electrochemical reduction of CO 2 (CO 2 RR) to multi-carbon products is a promising technology to store intermittent renewable electricity into high-added-value chemicals and close the carbon cycle. Its industrial scalability requires electrocatalysts to be highly selective to certain products, such as ethylene or ethanol. However, a substantial knowledge gap prevents the design of tailor-made materials, as the properties ruling the catalyst selectivity remain elusive. Here we combined in situ surface-enhanced Raman spectroscopy and density functional theory on Cu electrocatalysts to unveil the reaction scheme for CO 2 RR to C 2+ products. Ethylene generation occurs when *OC\u2013CO(H) dimers form via CO coupling on undercoordinated Cu sites. The ethanol route opens up only in the presence of highly compressed and distorted Cu domains with deep s -band states via the crucial intermediate *OCHCH 2 . By identifying and tracking the critical intermediates and specific active sites, our work provides guidelines to selectively decouple ethylene and ethanol production on rationally designed catalysts.",

      "abstract": "Growing supermassive black holes (Active Galactic Nuclei; AGN) release energy with the potential to alter their host galaxies and larger-scale environment; a process named \u201cAGN feedback\u201d. Feedback is a required component of galaxy formation models and simulations to explain the observed properties of galaxy populations. We provide a broad overview of observational approaches that are designed to establish the physical processes that couple AGN energy to the multi-phase gas, or to find evidence that AGN impact upon galaxy evolution. The orders-of-magnitude range in spatial, temporal, and temperature scales, requires a diverse set of observational studies. For example, studying individual targets in detail sheds light on coupling mechanisms; however, evidence for the long-term impact of AGN is better established within galaxy populations that are not necessarily currently active. We emphasise how modern surveys have revealed the importance of radio emission for identifying and characterising feedback mechanisms. At the achieved sensitivities, the detected radio emission can trace a range of processes, including a shocked interstellar medium caused by AGN outflows (driven by various mechanisms including radiation pressure, accretion disc winds, and jets). We also describe how interpreting observations in the context of theoretical work can be challenging, in part, due to some of the adopted terminology.",

Utilizing crystal-growth algorithms and spatial autocorrelation, the research algorithmically interprets spatial centers, and conducts kernel density and natural break classification analyses on public service facilities. The case of Guangzhou's central urban area reveals: 1) The spatial centers are in Liwan, Yuexiu, and Haizhu districts; 2) Centers are dispersed within a five-minute range but cluster over thirty minutes; 3) Analysis of coupling at different scales highlights areas needing more public service facilities. This methodology elucidates the relationship between spatial elements and structure, enriching community living circle theory and contributing to urban high-quality development.",

      "abstract": "Vertical equilibrium models have proven to be well suited for simulating fluid flow in subsurface porous media such as saline aquifers with caprocks. However, in most cases the dimensionally reduced model lacks the accuracy to capture the dynamics of a system. While conventional full-dimensional models have the ability to represent dynamics, they come at the cost of high computational effort. We aim to combine the efficiency of the vertical equilibrium model and the accuracy of the full-dimensional model by coupling the two models adaptively in a unified framework and solving the emerging system of equations in a monolithic, fully-implicit approach. The model domains are coupled via mass-conserving fluxes while the model adaptivity is ruled by adaption criteria. Overall, the adaptive model shows an excellent behaviour both in terms of accuracy as well as efficiency, especially for elongated geometries of storage systems with large aspect ratios.",
