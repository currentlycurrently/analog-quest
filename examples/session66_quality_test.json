Building on the results of the preceding Letter [Phys. Rev. Lett. 131, 060404 (2023)10.1103/PhysRevLett.131.060404], we explore features of scale-invariant dynamics of survival probability and SFF at criticality, i.e., at eigenstate transitions from quantum chaos to localization. We show that, in contrast to the quantum chaotic regime, the quantum dynamics at criticality do not only exhibit scale invariance at late times, but also at much shorter times that we refer to as mid-time dynamics. Our results apply to both quadratic and interacting models. Specifically, we study Anderson models in dimensions three to five and power-law random banded matrices for the former, and the quantum sun model and the ultrametric model for the latter, as well as the Rosenzweig-Porter model.",

      "title": "Critical-like Brain Dynamics in a Continuum from Second- to First-Order Phase Transition",
      "abstract": "The classic brain criticality hypothesis postulates that the brain benefits from operating near a continuous second-order phase transition. Slow feedback regulation of neuronal activity could, however, lead to a discontinuous first-order transition and thereby bistable activity. Observations of bistability in awake brain activity have nonetheless remained scarce and its functional significance unclear. Moreover, there is no empirical evidence to support the hypothesis that the human brain could flexibly operate near either a first- or second-order phase transition despite such a continuum being common in models. Here, using computational modeling, we found bistable synchronization dynamics to emerge through elevated positive feedback and occur exclusively in a regimen of critical-like dynamics. We then assessed bistability in vivo with resting-state MEG in healthy adults (7 females, 11 males) and stereo-electroencephalography in epilepsy patients (28 females, 36 males). This analysis revealed that a large fraction of the neocortices exhibited varying degrees of bistability in neuronal oscillations from 3 to 200 Hz. In line with our modeling results, the neuronal bistability was positively correlated with classic assessment of brain criticality across narrow-band frequencies. Excessive bistability was predictive of epileptic pathophysiology in the patients, whereas moderate bistability was positively correlated with task performance in the healthy subjects. These empirical findings thus reveal the human brain as a one-of-a-kind complex system that exhibits critical-like dynamics in a continuum between continuous and discontinuous phase transitions. SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT In the model, while synchrony per se was controlled by connectivity, increasing positive local feedback led to gradually emerging bistable synchrony with scale-free dynamics, suggesting a continuum between second- and first-order phase transitions in synchrony dynamics inside a critical-like regimen. In resting-state MEG and SEEG, bistability of ongoing neuronal oscillations was pervasive across brain areas and frequency bands and was observed only with concurring critical-like dynamics as the modeling predicted. As evidence for functional relevance, moderate bistability was positively correlated with executive functioning in the healthy subjects, and excessive bistability was associated with epileptic pathophysiology. These findings show that critical-like neuronal dynamics in vivo involves both continuous and discontinuous phase transitions in a frequency-, neuroanatomy-, and state-dependent manner.",

      "abstract": "Focal epileptic seizures can remain localized or, alternatively, spread across brain areas, often resulting in impairment of cognitive function and loss of consciousness. Understanding the factors that promote spread is important for developing better therapeutic approaches. Here, we show that: (1) seizure spread undergoes \u201ccritical\u201d phase transitions in models (epileptor-networks) that capture the neural dynamics of spontaneous seizures while incorporating patient-specific brain network connectivity, axonal delays and identified epileptogenic zones (EZs). We define a collective variable for the spreading dynamics as the spread size, i.e. the number of areas or nodes in the network to which a seizure has spread. Global connectivity strength and excitability in the surrounding non-epileptic areas work as phase-transition control parameters for this collective variable. (2) Phase diagrams are predicted by stability analysis of the network dynamics. (3) In addition, the components of the Jacobian\u2019s leading eigenvector, which tend to reflect the connectivity strength and path lengths from the EZ to surrounding areas, predict the temporal order of network-node recruitment into seizure. (4) However, stochastic fluctuations in spread size in a near-criticality region make predictability more challenging. Overall, our findings support the view that within-patient seizure-spread variability can be characterized by phase-transition dynamics under transient variations in network connectivity strength and excitability across brain areas. Furthermore, they point to the potential use and limitations of model-based prediction of seizure spread in closed-loop interventions for seizure control.",

In this paper, we demonstrate the quantum critical dynamics under dimensional crossover involving many-body phase transitions by continuously suppressing correlations and tunnelings along one direction of bulk materials, which provides a smooth connection from higher dimensions to lower ones based on the intrinsic correlations rather than geometry tailoring. By measuring the nonadiabatic excitations, the critical scaling laws in both three and two dimensions are observed and are consistent with predictions. In addition, we find scaling behaviors for intermediate regimes with noninteger dimensions.

      "abstract": ".A function with finite asymptotic limits gives rise to a transition equation between a \"past system\" and a \"future system.\" This question is analyzed in the case of nonautonomous coercive nonlinear scalar ordinary differential equations with concave derivative with respect to the state variable. The fundamental hypothesis is the existence of three hyperbolic solutions for the limit systems, in which case the upper and lower ones are attractive. All the global dynamical possibilities are described in terms of the internal dynamics of the pullback attractor: cases of tracking of the two hyperbolic attractive solutions or lack of it (tipping) may arise. This analysis, made in the language of processes and also in terms of the skewproduct formulation of the problem, includes cases of rate-induced critical transitions, as well as cases of phase-induced and size-induced tipping. The conclusions are applied in models of mathematical biology and population dynamics. Rate-induced tracking phenomena causing extinction of a native species or invasion of a nonnative one are described, as well as population models affected by a Holling type III functional response to predation where tipping due to the changes in the size of the transition may occur. In all these cases, the appearance of a critical transition can be understood as a consequence of the strength of the Allee effect.Keywordsnonautonomous dynamical systems population dynamics Allee effect critical transitionsd-concave scalar ODEsMSC codes37B5537G3537N2534D45",

For weak monitoring, we identify a novel dynamical regime of subextensive entanglement growth, reminiscent of a critical phase with an emergent conformal invariance. For strong monitoring, however, the dynamics favors a transition into a quantum Zeno-like area-law regime. Close to the critical point, we observe logarithmic finite size corrections, indicating a Berezinskii-Kosterlitz-Thouless mechanism underlying the transition. This uncovers an unconventional entanglement transition in an elementary, physically realistic model for weak continuous measurements. In addition, we demonstrate that the measurement aspect in the dynamics is crucial for whether or not a phase transition takes place.",

      "abstract": "Here, we present a theory of the entanglement transition tuned by measurement strength in qudit chains evolved by random unitary circuits and subject to either weak or random projective measurements. The transition can be understood as a nonanalytic change in the amount of information extracted by the measurements about the initial state of the system, quantified by the Fisher information. To compute the von Neumann entanglement entropy $\\\\textit{S}$ and the Fisher information $\\\\mathcal{F}$, we apply a replica method based on a sequence of quantities $\\\\tilde{S}^{(n)}$ and $\\\\mathcal{F}^{(n)}$ that depend on the $\\\\textit{n}$th moments of density matrices and reduce to $\\\\textit{S}$ and $\\\\mathcal{F}$ in the limit $\\\\textit{n}$ \u2192 1. These quantities with $\\\\textit{n}$ \u2265 2 are mapped to free energies of a classical spin model with $\\\\textit{n}$! internal states in two dimensions with specific boundary conditions. In particular, $\\\\tilde{S}^{(n)}$ is the excess free energy of a domain wall terminating on the top boundary, and $\\\\mathcal{F}^{(n)}$ is related to the magnetization on the bottom boundary. Phase transitions occur as the spin models undergo ordering transitions in the bulk. Taking the limit of large local Hilbert space dimension $\\\\textit{q}$ followed by the replica limit $\\\\textit{n}$ \u2192 1, we obtain the critical measurement probability $p_c$ = 1/2 and identify the transition as a bond percolation in the 2D square lattice in this limit. Finally, we show there is no phase transition if the measurements are allowed in an arbitrary nonlocal basis, thereby highlighting the relation between the phase transition and information scrambling. We establish an explicit connection between the entanglement phase transition and the purification dynamics of a mixed state evolution and discuss implications of our results to experimental observations of the transition and simulability of quantum dynamics.",

      "abstract": "A bstract We study the critical phenomena of the dynamical transition from a metastable state to a stable state in the model of first-order phase transition via two different triggering mechanisms. Three universal stages during the fully nonlinear evolution are extracted. On the one side, by perturbing the scalar source, an isolated seed nucleus is injected into an initial homogeneous state in the supercooled region. For critical parameters of the seed nucleus, the real-time dynamics reveal that the system will converge to a critically unstable state. For supercritical parameters, the system exhibits a phase separation, while for subcritical parameters falls back to homogeneous. The shape independence of the seed nucleus is also investigated, which implies that the critical phenomena are universal. On the other side, we propose a novel mechanism to render the critical phenomena via a collision of two gravitational shock waves on the dual geometries. Specifying an inhomogeneous momentum density, the initial system can be also attracted to a critically unstable state. Aside from these dynamical constructions, we also quantitatively analyze the critical nucleus preventing the system from reaching the final phase separation. We find the depth of the critical nucleus increases almost linearly with the temperature, which implies that the hotter the supercooled state is, the harder for it to trigger phase separation.",

Focusing on quadratic fermionic Hamiltonians that exhibit localization transitions, we identify physical observables that exhibit scale-invariant critical dynamics at the transition when quenched from the initially localized charge-density-wave states. The identification is based on two ingredients: (a) a relationship between the time evolution of observables in a many-body state and the transition probabilities of single-particle states, and (b) scale invariance of transition probabilities, which generalizes the corresponding recent result for survival probabilities [M. Hopjan and L. Vidmar, Phys. Rev. Lett. 131, 060404 (2023); Phys. Rev. Res. 5, 043301 (2023)]. These properties suggest that the scale-invariant critical dynamics in the quantum-quench dynamics is also exhibited by the observables, which share the common eigenbasis with the Hamiltonian before the quench. Focusing on experimentally relevant observables such as site occupations and the particle imbalance, we numerically demonstrate their critical behavior at the eigenstate transitions in the three-dimensional Anderson model and the one-dimensional Aubry-Andr\\'e model.",

We derive nonperturbative RG flow equations for the kinetic coefficients of both, model G and H, in parallel, and discuss commonalities and differences in the resulting fixed-point structure and dynamic critical exponents, such as weak-scaling relations which hold in either case versus the characteristic strong scaling of model G which is absent in model H.",

This general goal is achieved in two ways: first, through a profiled literature analysis, showing the historical progress and current state of the research; and second, through reference to the history of stability studies as an example of selected studies\u2019 development. In addition, this work has two more specific goals. Together, they consist of collecting the literature in a related field in one place and analyzing it on site to accomplish the review. Both specific goals are attained by dividing the literature into two corresponding parts. In the first part, the current issues of rail vehicle stability are analyzed and divided into four problems. The second part includes works that deal with the subject of the motion and dynamics of a rail vehicle on a transition curve section. Here, the works are divided into five groups and discussed.

      "title": "Entanglement Phase Transitions in Measurement-Only Dynamics",
      "abstract": "Unitary circuits subject to repeated projective measurements can undergo an entanglement phase transition (EPT) as a function of the measurement rate. This transition is generally understood in terms of a competition between the scrambling effects of unitary dynamics and the disentangling effects of measurements. We find that, surprisingly, EPTs are possible even in the absence of scrambling unitary dynamics, where they are best understood as arising from measurements alone. This finding motivates us to introduce measurement-only models, in which the \u201cscrambling\u201d and \u201cunscrambling\u201d effects driving the EPT are fundamentally intertwined and cannot be attributed to physically distinct processes. These models represent a novel form of an EPT, conceptually distinct from that in hybrid unitary-projective circuits. We explore the entanglement phase diagrams, critical points, and quantum code properties of some of these measurement-only models. We find that the principle driving the EPTs in these models is frustration, or mutual incompatibility, of the measurements. Surprisingly, an entangling (volume-law) phase is the generic outcome when measuring sufficiently long but still local (\u2273 3 -body) operators. We identify a class of exceptions to this behavior (\u201cbipartite ensembles\u201d) which cannot sustain an entangling phase but display dual area-law phases, possibly with different kinds of quantum order, separated by self-dual critical points. Finally, we introduce a measure of information spreading in dynamics with measurements and use it to demonstrate the emergence of a statistical light cone, despite the nonlocality inherent to quantum measurements.",

      "abstract": "An inevitable consequence of the global power system transition toward nearly 100% renewable-based generation is the loss of conventional bulk generation by synchronous machines (SMs), their inertia, and accompanying frequency- and voltage-control mechanisms. This gradual transformation of the power system to a low-inertia system leads to critical challenges in maintaining system stability. Novel control techniques for converters, so-called grid-forming strategies, are expected to address these challenges and replicate functionalities that, so far, have been provided by SMs. This article presents a low-inertia case study that includes SMs and converters controlled under various grid-forming techniques. In this article, the positive impact of the grid-forming converters (GFCs) on the frequency stability of SMs is highlighted, a qualitative analysis that provides insights into the frequency stability of the system is presented, we explore the behavior of the grid-forming controls when imposing the converter dc and ac current limitations, the importance of the dc dynamics in grid-forming control design as well as the critical need for an effective ac current limitation scheme are reported, and finally, we analyze how and when the interaction between the fast GFC and the slow SM dynamics can contribute to the system instability.",

      "abstract": "Optically active molecular materials, such as organic conjugated polymers and biological systems, are characterized by strong coupling between electronic and vibrational degrees of freedom. Typically, simulations must go beyond the Born-Oppenheimer approximation to account for non-adiabatic coupling between excited states. Indeed, non-adiabatic dynamics is commonly associated with exciton dynamics and photophysics involving charge and energy transfer, as well as exciton dissociation and charge recombination. Understanding the photoinduced dynamics in such materials is vital to providing an accurate description of exciton formation, evolution, and decay. This interdisciplinary field has matured significantly over the past decades. Formulation of new theoretical frameworks, development of more efficient and accurate computational algorithms, and evolution of high-performance computer hardware has extended these simulations to very large molecular systems with hundreds of atoms, including numerous studies of organic semiconductors and biomolecules. In this Review, we will describe recent theoretical advances including treatment of electronic decoherence in surface-hopping methods, the role of solvent effects, trivial unavoided crossings, analysis of data based on transition densities, and efficient computational implementations of these numerical methods. We also emphasize newly developed semiclassical approaches, based on the Gaussian approximation, which retain phase and width information to account for significant decoherence and interference effects while maintaining the high efficiency of surface-hopping approaches. The above developments have been employed to successfully describe photophysics in a variety of molecular materials.",

      "abstract": "Understanding limit-cycle oscillators' collective dynamics and phase transitions is crucial in science and engineering. We study a system of identical nonisochronous Stuart-Landau oscillators with asymmetric and symmetric couplings on a ring network. Due to the interplay of the two couplings, oscillators can have various modes of phase relationships: phase-lockings, and phase-drifts. Phase-locked states give rise to different symmetric collective states, whereas phase-drift states lead to asymmetric collective states. We derive the common frequency and amplitude solutions of oscillators in phase-locking states. By defining an order parameter for the system and computing quantities such as effective frequencies, amplitudes, and phase dispersions, we obtain a phase diagram of the system and identify distinct collective dynamical regimes: (i) Complete phase locking, resulting in full synchronization. (ii) Phase drifts among oscillators, leading to quasiperiodic traveling waves. (iii) Uniform phase distributions among oscillators, giving rise to various splay states. (iv) Oscillation death with different steady states. Continuous and discontinuous phase transitions operate across different collective dynamical regimes. The phase transition operating across complete synchronization and traveling wave states is continuous, while the phase transition operating across traveling wave and splay states is discontinuous and is associated with hysteresis. Furthermore, the oscillators impart an explosive oscillation death, even if all the oscillators have the same frequency, along the routes across the splay and complete synchronization states. Finally, we highlight the implications for biological and physical applications.",

Recent work in physics and neuroscience highlights the importance of higher-order interactions between dynamical units, i.e., three- and four-way interactions in addition to pairwise interactions, and their role in shaping collective behavior. Here we show that higher-order interactions between coupled phase oscillators, encoded microscopically in a simplicial complex, give rise to added nonlinearity in the macroscopic system dynamics that induces abrupt synchronization transitions via hysteresis and bistability of synchronized and incoherent states. Moreover, these higher-order interactions can stabilize strongly synchronized states even when the pairwise coupling is repulsive. These findings reveal a self-organized phenomenon that may be responsible for the rapid switching to synchronization in many biological and other systems that exhibit synchronization without the need of particular correlation mechanisms between the oscillators and the topological structure.",

We exploit its electro-optics to visualize the appearance, in the absence of applied field, of a permanent electric polarization density, manifested as a spontaneously broken symmetry in distinct domains of opposite polar orientation. Polarization reversal is mediated by field-induced domain wall movement, making this phase ferroelectric, a 3D uniaxial nematic having a spontaneous, reorientable polarization locally parallel to the director. This polarization density saturates at a low temperature value of \u223c6 \u00b5C/cm 2 , the largest ever measured for a fluid or glassy material. This polarization is comparable to that of solid state ferroelectrics and is close to the average value obtained by assuming perfect, polar alignment of molecular dipoles in the nematic. We find a host of spectacular optical and hydrodynamic effects driven by ultralow applied field (E \u223c 1 V/cm), produced by the coupling of the large polarization to nematic birefringence and flow. Electrostatic self-interaction of the polarization charge renders the transition from the nematic phase mean field-like and weakly first order and controls the director field structure of the ferroelectric phase. Atomistic molecular dynamics simulation reveals short-range polar molecular interactions that favor ferroelectric ordering, including a tendency for head-to-tail association into polar, chain-like assemblies having polar lateral correlations.

Here we address this point in a quantum gas that is strongly coupled to a lossy optical cavity mode using two independent Raman drives, which act on the spin and motional degrees of freedom of the atoms. This setting allows us to control the competition between coherent dynamics and dissipation by adjusting the imbalance between the drives. For strong enough coupling, the transition to a superradiant phase occurs, as is the case for a closed system. Yet, by imbalancing the drives we can enter a dissipation-stabilized normal phase and a region of multistability. Measuring the properties of excitations on top of the out-of-equilibrium phases reveals the microscopic elementary processes in the open system.

      "abstract": "Solar cells and optoelectronic devices are exposed to heat that degrades performance. Therefore, elucidating temperature-dependent charge carrier dynamics is essential for device optimization. Charge carrier lifetimes decrease with temperature in conventional semiconductors. The opposite, anomalous trend is observed in some experiments performed with MAPbI<sub>3</sub> (MA = CH<sub>3</sub>NH<sub>3</sub><sup>+</sup>) and other metal halide perovskites. Using ab initio quantum dynamics simulation, we establish the atomic mechanisms responsible for nonradiative electron-hole recombination in orthorhombic-, tetragonal-, and cubic MAPbI<sub>3</sub>. We demonstrate that structural disorder arising from the phase transitions is as important as the disorder due to heating in the same phase. The carrier lifetimes grow both with increasing temperature in the same phase and upon transition to the higher-temperature phases. The increased lifetime is rationalized by structural disorder that induces partial charge localization, decreases nonadiabatic coupling, and shortens quantum coherence. Inelastic and elastic electron-vibrational interactions exhibit opposite dependence on temperature and phase. The partial disorder and localization arise from thermal motions of both the inorganic lattice and the organic cations and depend significantly on the phase. The structural deformations induced by thermal fluctuations and phase transitions are on the same order as deformations induced by defects, and hence, thermal disorder plays a very important role. Since charge localization increases carrier lifetimes but inhibits transport, an optimal regime maximizing carrier diffusion can be designed, depending on phase, temperature, material morphology, and device architecture. The atomistic mechanisms responsible for the enhanced carrier lifetimes at elevated temperatures provide guidelines for the design of improved solar energy and optoelectronic materials.",

The unique optical features of these J-aggregates are narrowed, bathochromically shifted absorption bands with almost resonant fluorescence with an increased radiative rate that results from the coherently coupled molecular transition dipoles arranged in a slip-stacked fashion. Because of their desirable properties, J-aggregates gained popularity in the field of functional materials and enabled the efficient photosensitization of silver halide grains in color photography. However, despite a good theoretical understanding of structure-property relationships by the molecular exciton model, further examples of J-aggregates remained scarce for a long time as supramolecular designs to guide the formation of dye aggregates into the required slip-stacked arrangement were lacking.Drawing inspiration from the bacteriochlorophyll <i>c</i> self-organization found in the chlorosomal light-harvesting antennas of green sulfur bacteria, we envisioned the use of nature's supramolecular blueprint to develop J-aggregates of perylene bisimides (PBIs). This class of materials is applied in high-performance color pigments and as n-type organic semiconductors in transistors and solar cells. Combining outstanding photochemical and thermal stability, high tinctorial strength and excellent fluorescence, PBIs are therefore an ideal model system for the preparation of J-aggregates with a wide range of potential applications.In this Account, we elucidate how a combination of steric constraints and hydrogen bonding receptor sites can guide the self-assembly of PBI dyes into slip-stacked packing motifs with J-type exciton coupling. We will discuss the supramolecular polymerization of multiple hydrogen-bonded PBI strands in organic and aqueous media and how minor structural modifications in monomeric PBI molecules can be used to obtain near-infrared absorbing J-aggregates, organogels, or thermoresponsive hydrogels. Pushing the boundaries of self-assembly into the bulk, engineering of the substituents' steric requirements by a dendron-wedge approach afforded adjustable numbers of helical strands of PBI J-aggregates in the columnar liquid-crystalline state and the preparation of lamellar phases. To fully explore their potential, we have studied PBI J-aggregates in collaborative work with spectroscopists, physicists, and theoreticians. In this way, exciton migration over distances of up to 180 nm was shown, and insights into the influence of static disorder on the transport of excitation energy in PBI J-aggregates were derived. Furthermore, the application of PBI J-aggregates as functional materials was demonstrated in photonic microcavities, thin-film transistors, and organic solar cells.",

      "abstract": "Abstract Buildup and switching mechanisms of solitons in complex nonlinear systems are fundamentally important dynamical regimes. Using a novel strongly nonlinear optical system, including saturable absorber metal\u2010organic framework (MOF)\u2010253@Au and a polarization controller (PC), the work reveals a new buildup scenario for \u201csoliton molecules (SMs)\u201d, which includes a long\u2010duration stage dominated by the emergence of transient noise\u2010like pulses (NLPs) modes to withstand strong disturbances arising from \u201cturbulence\u201d and extreme nonlinearity in the optical cavity. The switching between SMs and NLPs is controlled by the cavity polarization state. The switching involves the spectral collapse, following spectral oscillations with a variable period, and self\u2010organization of NLPs, following energy overshoot. This switching mechanism applies to various patterns with single, paired, and clustered pulses. In the multi\u2010pulses stage, XPM (cross\u2010phase\u2010modulation)\u2010induced interactions between solitons facilitate a specific mode of energy exchange between them, proportional to interaction duration, ensuring pulse stability during and after state transitions. Systematic simulations reveal the effects of the PC's rotation angle and intra\u2010cavity nonlinearity on the periodic phase transitions between the different soliton states and accurately reproduce the experimentally observed buildup and switching mechanisms. These findings can enhance the fundamental study and points to potential uses in designing information encoding systems.",

Investigation of such dynamical processes is important both for understanding the emergence of exotic topological spin textures, and for future engineering of skyrmions in technological applications. However, while the annihilation of skyrmions has been extensively investigated in two dimensions, in three dimensions the phase transitions are considerably more complex. We report field-dependent experimental measurements of metastable skyrmion lifetimes in an archetypal chiral magnet, revealing two distinct regimes. Comparison to supporting three-dimensional geodesic nudged elastic band simulations indicates that these correspond to skyrmion annihilation into either the helical and conical states, each exhibiting a different transition mechanism. The results highlight that the lowest energy magnetic configuration of the system plays a crucial role when considering the emergence and stability of topological spin structures via defect-mediated dynamics.",

      "abstract": "Coacervates are droplets formed by liquid-liquid phase separation (LLPS) and are often used as model protocells-primitive cell-like compartments that could have aided the emergence of life. Their continued presence as membraneless organelles in modern cells gives further credit to their relevance. The local physicochemical environment inside coacervates is distinctly different from the surrounding dilute solution and offers an interesting microenvironment for prebiotic reactions. Coacervates can selectively take up reactants and enhance their effective concentration, stabilize products, destabilize reactants and lower transition states, and can therefore play a similar role as micellar catalysts in providing rate enhancement and selectivity in reaction outcome. Rate enhancement and selectivity must have been essential for the origins of life by enabling chemical reactions to occur at appreciable rates and overcoming competition from hydrolysis. In this Accounts, we dissect the mechanisms by which coacervate protocells can accelerate reactions and provide selectivity. These mechanisms can similarly be exploited by membraneless organelles to control cellular processes. First, coacervates can affect the local concentration of reactants and accelerate reactions by copartitioning of reactants or exclusion of a product or inhibitor. Second, the local environment inside the coacervate can change the energy landscape for reactions taking place inside the droplets. The coacervate is more apolar than the surrounding solution and often rich in charged moieties, which can affect the stability of reactants, transition states and products. The crowded nature of the droplets can favor complexation of large molecules such as ribozymes. Their locally different proton and water activity can facilitate reactions involving a (de)protonation step, condensation reactions and reactions that are sensitive to hydrolysis. Not only the coacervate core, but also the surface can accelerate reactions and provides an interesting site for chemical reactions with gradients in pH, water activity and charge. The coacervate is often rich in catalytic amino acids and can localize catalysts like divalent metal ions, leading to further rate enhancement inside the droplets. Lastly, these coacervate properties can favor certain reaction pathways, and thereby give selectivity over the reaction outcome. These mechanisms are further illustrated with a case study on ribozyme reactions inside coacervates, for which there is a fine balance between concentration and reactivity that can be tuned by the coacervate composition. Furthermore, coacervates can both catalyze ribozyme reactions and provide product selectivity, demonstrating that coacervates could have functioned as enzyme-like catalytic microcompartments at the origins of life.",

The model is depinning-like and driven by a disordered thresholds dynamics that is coupled by long-range elastic interactions. We propose a simple protocol of \u201cglass preparation\u201d that allows us to mimic thermalization at high temperatures as well as aging at vanishing temperature. Various levels of glass stabilities (from brittle to ductile) can be achieved by tuning the aging duration. The aged glasses are then immersed into a quenched disorder landscape and serve as initial configurations for various protocols of mechanical loading by shearing. The dependence of the plastic behavior upon monotonous loading is recovered. The behavior under cyclic loading is studied for different ages and system sizes. The size and age dependence of the irreversibility transition is discussed. A thorough characterization of the disorder-landscape is achieved through the analysis of the transition graphs, which describe the plastic deformation pathways under athermal quasi-static shear. In particular, the analysis of the stability ranges of the strongly connected components of the transition graphs reveals the emergence of a phase-separation like process associated with the aging of the glass. Increasing the age and, hence, the stability of the initial glass results in a gradual break-up of the landscape of dynamically accessible stable states into three distinct regions: one region centered around the initially prepared glass phase and two additional regions characterized by well-separated ranges of positive and negative plastic strains, each of which is accessible only from the initial glass phase by passing through the stress peak in the forward and backward, respectively, shearing directions.",

      "abstract": "Disease-associated progression of protein dysfunction is typically determined by an interplay of transition pathways leading to liquid-liquid phase separation (LLPS) and amyloid fibrils. As LLPS introduces another layer of complexity into fibrillization of metastable proteins, a need for tunable model systems to study these intertwined processes has emerged. Here, we demonstrate the LLPS/fibrillization properties of a family of chimeric peptides, ACC<sub>1-13</sub>K<sub><i>n</i></sub>, in which the highly amyloidogenic fragment of insulin (ACC<sub>1-13</sub>) is merged with oligolysine segments of various lengths (K<sub><i>n</i></sub>, <i>n</i> = 8, 16, 24, 32, 40). LLPS and fibrillization of ACC<sub>1-13</sub>K<sub><i>n</i></sub> are triggered by ATP through Coulombic interactions with K<sub><i>n</i></sub> fragments. ACC<sub>1-13</sub>K<sub>8</sub> and ACC<sub>1-13</sub>K<sub>16</sub> form fibrils after a short lag phase without any evidence of LLPS. However, in the case of the three longest peptides, ATP triggers instantaneous LLPS followed by the disappearance of droplets occurring <i>in-phase</i> with the formation of amyloid fibrils. The kinetics of the phase transition and the stability of mature co-aggregates are highly sensitive to ionic strength, indicating that electrostatic interactions play a pivotal role in selecting the LLPS-fibrillization transition pathway. Densely packed ionic interactions that characterize ACC<sub>1-13</sub>K<sub><i>n</i></sub>-ATP fibrils render them highly sensitive to hydrostatic pressure due to solvent electrostriction, as demonstrated by infrared spectroscopy. Using atomic force microscopy imaging of rapidly frozen samples, we demonstrate that early fibrils form within single liquid droplets, starting at the droplet/bulk interface through the formation of single bent fibers. A hypothetical molecular scenario underlying the emergence of the LLPS-to-fibrils pathway in the ACC<sub>1-13</sub>K<sub><i>n</i></sub>-ATP system has been put forward.",

Recently, a novel membrane architecture was proposed to explain the membrane stability in polyextremophiles unable to synthesize such lipids, in which apolar polyisoprenoids populate the bilayer midplane and modify its physico-chemistry, extending its stability domain. Here, we have studied the effect of the apolar polyisoprenoid squalane on a model membrane analogue using neutron diffraction, SAXS and fluorescence spectroscopy. We show that squalane resides inside the bilayer midplane, extends its stability domain, reduces its permeability to protons but increases that of water, and induces a negative curvature in the membrane, allowing the transition to novel non-lamellar phases. This membrane architecture can be transposed to early membranes and could help explain their emergence and temperature tolerance if life originated near hydrothermal vents. Transposed to the archaeal bilayer, this membrane architecture could explain the tolerance to high temperature in hyperthermophiles which grow at temperatures over 100 \u00b0C while having a membrane bilayer. The induction of a negative curvature to the membrane could also facilitate crucial cell functions that require high bending membranes.",

We study the dynamics of two distinct turbulent thermoacoustic systems, bluff-body and swirl-stabilized combustors, where the transition occurs from the state of combustion noise (chaos) to thermoacoustic instability (order) via the route of intermittency. Using unweighted complex networks built from phase space cycles of the acoustic pressure oscillations, we characterize the topology of the phase space during various dynamical states in these combustors. We propose the use of network centrality measures derived from cycle networks as a novel means to characterize the number and stability of periodic orbits in the phase space and to study the topological transformations in the phase space during the emergence of order from chaos in the combustors. During the state of combustion noise, we show that the phase space consists of several unstable periodic orbits, which influence the phase space trajectory. As order emerges in the system dynamics, the number of periodic orbits decreases and their stability increases. At the onset of oscillatory dynamics, the phase space consists of a stable periodic orbit. We also use network centrality measures to identify the onset of thermoacoustic instability in both the combustors. Finally, we propose that the onset of oscillatory instabilities in turbulent systems is analogous to Bose\u2013Einstein condensation transition observed for bosons, if we define phase space cycles as particles and the periodic orbits as energy levels.",

As we transition to endemicity, inequitable access to vaccines, and particularly in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs), still poses risks of unprecedented disruptions and the emergence of viral mutations, which potentially lead to notorious vaccine-resistant variants. The missteps learned from the previous responses to the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and influenza outbreaks founded the hypothetical plan to ensure that vaccine accessibility to LMICs is not impeded. The SARS-CoV-2 vaccines\u2019 social promise was to lessen the underlying racial, ethnic, and geographic inequities that COVID-19 has both made apparent and intensified. Vaccine nationalism was evident throughout the COVID-19 crisis. Many high-income countries directly negotiated large advance orders for the vaccines, leaving resource-limited countries scrambling for access. This occurred despite international initiatives to structure the development and equitable distribution of vaccines, channeled through a vaccine pillar: COVID-19 Vaccines Global Access (COVAX). The serious supply shortages and national procurement methods of some countries that bypassed the vaccine pillar hindered the optimal function of COVAX in delivering timely and adequate doses to participating countries. COVAX strategized its approach by promoting fundraising, coordinating vaccine donations from countries with surplus doses, expediting reviews of vaccine candidates, and facilitating the expansion of the manufacturing capacity. While increasing capacity for production, technology transfer led to lesser siloes, enhanced manufacturing standardization, and less secrecy over production data. Ultracold storage requirements for leading vaccines were a considerable hurdle to the global immunization efforts, and particularly in LMICs with limited equipment and resources to support sophisticated cold-chain systems. Manufacturers strived to ease cold-chain restrictions on the basis of stability data submitted to national regulatory bodies. The development of single-dose vaccines offered promising solutions to simplify the administrative and logistic complexities that existed within the COVID-19 vaccination programs. As such, the requirements for both ultracold storage conditions were eased, and concerns over booster doses were addressed. To expand coverage, the dosing intervals of the Oxford/AstraZeneca vaccines were extended according to data from Phase III clinical trials on effectiveness. In addition, with the recent outbreak of monkeypox, the lessons from past experiences of curbing infectious diseases, including COVID-19, must be learned and acted upon.

We also predicted an electron doping range, within which the ferromagnetism can be enhanced, while the ferromagnetic stability was maintained. Moreover, we found that the compressive strain can reverse the spin polarization of electrons at the conduction band minimum, so that two categories of half-metal can be induced by controlling electrostatic doping in the bilayer Cr 2 Ge 2 Te 6 .

Herein, the main challenges for these emergent pc-LEDs are to achieve full-spectrum lighting, wide color gamut display and broadband high efficiency near-infrared emission, respectively, which depends on the luminescence properties of phosphors used. Owing to the unique 4f-5d transition, Eu2+ is one of the most commonly used activators in luminescent materials for pc-LEDs, and Eu2+-doped earth-abundant silicates phosphors exhibit outstanding luminescence properties, including multicolor emission, adjustable bandwidth, excellent thermal stability as well as high luminescence efficiency. These attributes motivate scientists to find Eu2+-doped silicates phosphors that can practically meet the various LED application requirements. Since the traditional trial and error exploration is time-consuming and not necessarily successful, it is necessary to find reliable structural engineering strategies to discover new phosphor systems and also realize purposeful photoluminescence tuning. The adjustable 4f-5d electronic transitions of Eu2+, the variable crystal structures of the silicate hosts and their coupling effect simultaneously account for the targeted luminescence behaviors and their precise emission color tuning. Thus, we aim at developing Eu2+-doped silicate phosphors that can solve the application challenges through a comprehensive understanding of Eu2+ photoluminescence mechanism and the structure\u2013property relationships.In this Account, we first illustrate the luminescence theory of Eu2+ in inorganic solids and summarize the research results of the effect originated from centroid shift, crystal field splitting, Stokes shift, and emission bandwidth. On the basis of the factors dominating the variation of luminescence characteristics, several structural strategies to manipulate Eu2+ emission in silicates are proposed, including (1) modify the chemical composition and crystal structure by various substitutions, (2) choose or change a suitable crystallographic site for Eu2+ and (3) control crystalline phase transition by external factors. Meanwhile, we briefly introduce the photoluminescence behaviors of Eu2+ in different silicates controlled by these structural engineering strategies. Second, we outline our recent research progress on blue LED pumped Eu2+-doped silicate phosphors with emphasis on the design principle and the relationship between the structure and luminescence.

Not all of those can be coherently linked, some concepts are incommensurable, and domain-specific language poses an obstacle to integration. Still, conceptual integration is a form of understanding that provides intuition and consolidation, without which progress remains unguided. This paper is concerned with the integration of deterministic and stochastic processes within an information theoretic framework, linking information entropy and free energy to mechanisms of emergent dynamics and self-organization in brain networks. We identify basic properties of neuronal populations leading to an equivariant matrix in a network, in which complex behaviors can naturally be represented through structured flows on manifolds establishing the internal model relevant to theories of brain function. We propose a neural mechanism for the generation of internal models from symmetry breaking in the connectivity of brain networks. The emergent perspective illustrates how free energy can be linked to internal models and how they arise from the neural substrate.",

Recent research converges on an emergent mechanistic theory of temporal variability based on attractor neural networks and metastable dynamics, arising via coordinated interactions between mesoscopic neural circuits. We highlight the crucial role played by structural heterogeneities as well as noise from mesoscopic feedback loops in regulating flexible behavior.

      "abstract": "Collective intelligence, an emergent phenomenon in which a composite system of multiple interacting agents performs at levels greater than the sum of its parts, has long compelled research efforts in social and behavioral sciences. To date, however, formal models of collective intelligence have lacked a plausible mathematical description of the relationship between local-scale interactions between autonomous sub-system components (individuals) and global-scale behavior of the composite system (the collective). In this paper we use the Active Inference Formulation (AIF), a framework for explaining the behavior of any non-equilibrium steady state system at any scale, to posit a minimal agent-based model that simulates the relationship between local individual-level interaction and collective intelligence. We explore the effects of providing baseline AIF agents (Model 1) with specific cognitive capabilities: Theory of Mind (Model 2), Goal Alignment (Model 3), and Theory of Mind with Goal Alignment (Model 4). These stepwise transitions in sophistication of cognitive ability are motivated by the types of advancements plausibly required for an AIF agent to persist and flourish in an environment populated by other highly autonomous AIF agents, and have also recently been shown to map naturally to canonical steps in human cognitive ability. Illustrative results show that stepwise cognitive transitions increase system performance by providing complementary mechanisms for alignment between agents\u2019 local and global optima. Alignment emerges endogenously from the dynamics of interacting AIF agents themselves, rather than being imposed exogenously by incentives to agents\u2019 behaviors (contra existing computational models of collective intelligence) or top-down priors for collective behavior (contra existing multiscale simulations of AIF). These results shed light on the types of generic information-theoretic patterns conducive to collective intelligence in human and other complex adaptive systems.",

To explore the genetic mechanisms underlying microbiota-host relationships, many genome-wide association studies have begun to identify host genes that shape the microbial composition of the gut. It is becoming increasingly clear that the gut microbiota impacts host processes not only through the action of individual microbes but also their interaction networks. However, a systematic characterization of microbial interactions that occur in densely packed aggregates of the gut bacteria has proven to be extremely difficult. We develop a computational rule of thumb for addressing this issue by integrating ecological behavioral theory and genetic mapping theory. We introduce behavioral ecology theory to derive mathematical descriptors of how each microbe interacts with every other microbe through a web of cooperation and competition. We estimate the emergent properties of gut-microbiota networks reconstructed from these descriptors and map host-driven mutualism, antagonism, aggression, and altruism QTLs. We further integrate path analysis and mapping theory to detect and visualize how host genetic variants affect human diseases by perturbing the internal workings of the gut microbiota. As the proof of concept, we apply our model to analyze a published dataset of the gut microbiota, showing its usefulness and potential to gain new insight into how microbes are organized in human guts.

A CO order greater than unity is unique to Pd single atoms supported on CeO2 nanocubes and is not observed for Pd nanoparticles on the same support nor other supported single-atom systems. A reaction mechanism including eight elementary steps, in which Pd dynamically samples three formal oxidation states, is unable to capture a reaction order in CO greater than unity. Vibrational spectroscopy of CO adsorption ranging from lean to rich conditions reveals Pd accesses an extensive array of formal oxidation states, ranging from Pd4+ to Pd0. Density functional theory calculations demonstrate Pd atoms supported on CeO2 can access four formal oxidation states during lean CO oxidation. Two catalytic redox cycles are possible, with cross-over between them leading to a reaction mechanism yielding reaction orders in CO greater than unity. A microkinetic model, utilizing Bayesian inference to adjust elementary energetics to fit the experimentally measured activation barrier and reaction orders, confirms the reaction order in CO of >1 arises from the ability of the Pd active site to access four formal oxidation states, spanning from +4 (PdO2) to \u22122 (Pd adjacent to a CeO2 lattice oxygen vacancy). This work demonstrates the emergent redox behavior of Pd single atoms on CeO2, which may be important to explain their high activity for low-temperature catalytic combustion of hydrocarbons.",

Different behaviors can be realized by tuning swimmer interactions at the individual level in a manner analogous to the emergent collective behavior of bacteria and mammalian cells. However, the limited toolbox of weak forces with which to drive these systems has made it difficult to achieve useful collective functions. Here, we review recent research on driving swimming and particle self-organization using acoustic fields, which offers capabilities complementary to those of the other methods used to power microswimmers. With either chemical or acoustic propulsion (or a combination of the two), understanding individual swimming mechanisms and the forces that arise between individual particles is a prerequisite to harnessing their interactions to realize collective phenomena and macroscopic functionality. We discuss here the ingredients necessary to drive the motion of microscopic particles using ultrasound, the theory that describes that behavior, and the gaps in our understanding. We then cover the combination of acoustically powered systems with other cross-compatible driving forces and the use of ultrasound in generating collective behavior. Finally, we highlight the demonstrated applications of acoustically powered microswimmers, and we offer a perspective on the state of the field, open questions, and opportunities. We hope that this review will serve as a guide to students beginning their work in this area and motivate others to consider research in microswimmers and acoustic fields.",

Our study aims to illuminate prior ambiguous evidence by examining an employee\u2010level mechanism underlying the organizational\u2010level relationship between decentralization and performance, and scrutinizing the critical role of formal leaders for empowering employees in decentralized structures. Integrating the perspective of organizational structure as opportunities and constraints with social information processing theory, we argue that transferring decision\u2010making authority to lower organizational levels positively affects employees' emergent leadership, but only to the extent that direct supervisors engage in empowering leadership and guide employees' behaviors in decentralized structures. Our predictions are supported by a multilevel, multisource field study of 5807 individuals across 144 companies. We further find that emergent leadership yields a positive effect on organizational performance. By developing a multilevel model that explicates both an employee\u2010level mechanism and a contingency of the decentralization\u2013organizational performance link, our study enriches understanding of the key role that formal leaders play for achieving the strategic goals of decentralized decision\u2010making in organizations.",

In the latter context, gauge theories are becoming increasingly popular for capturing the intricate spin correlations in spin liquids, exotic states of matter in which the dynamics of quantum spins never ceases, even at absolute zero temperature. We consider a spin system on a three-dimensional pyrochlore lattice where emergent gauge fields not only describe the spin liquid behavior at zero temperature but crucially determine the system\u2019s temperature evolution, with distinct gauge fields giving rise to different spin liquid phases in separate temperature regimes. Focusing first on classical spins, in an intermediate temperature regime, the system shows an unusual coexistence of emergent vector and tensor gauge fields where the former is known from classical spin ice systems while the latter has been associated with fractonic quasiparticles, a peculiar type of excitation with restricted mobility. Upon cooling, the system transitions into a low-temperature phase where an entropic selection mechanism depopulates the degrees of freedom associated with the tensor gauge field, rendering the system spin-ice-like. We further provide numerical evidence that in the corresponding quantum model, a spin liquid with coexisting vector and tensor gauge fields has a finite window of stability in the parameter space of spin interactions down to zero temperature.

In this paper, we introduce generative agents: computational software agents that simulate believable human behavior. Generative agents wake up, cook breakfast, and head to work; artists paint, while authors write; they form opinions, notice each other, and initiate conversations; they remember and reflect on days past as they plan the next day. To enable generative agents, we describe an architecture that extends a large language model to store a complete record of the agent's experiences using natural language, synthesize those memories over time into higher-level reflections, and retrieve them dynamically to plan behavior. We instantiate generative agents to populate an interactive sandbox environment inspired by The Sims, where end users can interact with a small town of twenty-five agents using natural language. In an evaluation, these generative agents produce believable individual and emergent social behaviors. For example, starting with only a single user-specified notion that one agent wants to throw a Valentine's Day party, the agents autonomously spread invitations to the party over the next two days, make new acquaintances, ask each other out on dates to the party, and coordinate to show up for the party together at the right time. We demonstrate through ablation that the components of our agent architecture\u2014observation, planning, and reflection\u2014each contribute critically to the believability of agent behavior.

      "abstract": "Recent studies indicate that issues in compliance with building energy codes (BEC) are closely linked to practitioner's varying compliance behavior, which jeopardizes BEC's effectiveness and low-carbon target. Compliance usually means conforming to a rule, however what concerns BEC is going beyond minimal compliance. While building authorities introduce various interventions to promote practitioner's compliance, magnitude of behavior changes from these interventions is unknown. In addition to this, variables from disciplinary-isolated compliance theories may generate a limited understanding concerning practitioner's compliance behavior. Thus, this paper aims to conceptualize a cross-theoretical assessment model for building practitioner's compliance behavior with BEC. This is achieved over two steps. First, an assessment for individual practitioner's BEC compliance behavior is designed, integrating theory of planned behavior with compliance models from disciplines across criminology and psychology. This illustrates the variables that shape practitioner's compliance behavior, and classifies the practitioner's compliance behavioral states into: (1) not intended to go beyond minimal compliance, (2) intended but unsuccessful to go beyond minimal compliance, and (3) intended and successful to go beyond minimal compliance. Second, the model is expanded to aggregate-level by incorporating social influence theory. This enables a group-level time-dynamic assessment that considers interconnected practitioners' interactions. This model thus demonstrates assessment mechanism of characterizing building practitioner's emergent compliance behavior that results from inter-person interactions and regulatory interventions. Though this conceptual model is not yet empirically tested, it is designed based on well-established theories to ensure credibility. Eventually, this study informs authorities to formulate suitable and tailored interventions to promote compliance with BEC.",

In this work, we used a dissipative particle dynamics-based coarse-grained model to investigate the diffusion behavior of IgG1 antibody molecules in aqueous solutions with 15 and 32 mM NaCl and antibody concentrations ranging from 10 to 400 mg/mL. We determined the coarse-grained interaction parameters by matching the calculated structure factor with the computational and experimental data from the literature. Our results indicate Fickian diffusion for antibody concentrations of 10 and 25 mg/mL and anomalous diffusion for concentrations exceeding 50 mg/mL. The anomalous diffusion was observed for \u223c0.33 to 0.4 \u03bcs, followed by Fickian diffusion for all antibody concentrations. We observed a strong linear correlation between the diffusion behavior of the antibody molecules (diffusion coefficient <i>D</i> and anomalous diffusion exponent \u03b1) and the amount of aggregates present in the solution and between the amount of aggregates and the Coulomb interaction energy. The investigation of underlying mechanisms for anomalous diffusion revealed that in crowded environments at high antibody concentrations, the attractive interaction between electrostatically complementary regions of the antibody molecules could further bring the neighboring molecules closer to one another, ultimately resulting in aggregate formation. Further, the Coulomb attraction can continue to draw more molecules together, forming larger aggregates.",

Anomalous-diffusion emerges due to a variety of physical mechanisms, e.g., trapping interactions or the viscoelasticity of the environment. However, sometimes systems dynamics are erroneously claimed to be anomalous, despite the fact that the true motion is Brownian\u2014or vice versa. This ambiguity in establishing whether the dynamics as normal or anomalous can have far-reaching consequences, e.g., in predictions for reaction- or relaxation-laws. Demonstrating that a system exhibits normal- or anomalous-diffusion is highly desirable for a vast host of applications. Here, we present a criterion for anomalous-diffusion based on the method of power-spectral analysis of single trajectories. The robustness of this criterion is studied for trajectories of fractional-Brownian-motion, a ubiquitous stochastic process for the description of anomalous-diffusion, in the presence of two types of measurement errors. In particular, we find that our criterion is very robust for subdiffusion. Various tests on surrogate data in absence or presence of additional positional noise demonstrate the efficacy of this method in practical contexts. Finally, we provide a proof-of-concept based on diverse experiments exhibiting both normal and anomalous-diffusion.",

FC-C-C delivered (95.07 \u00b1 15.85)% in only 36 h, and the formulation released the drug by an anomalous diffusion mechanism. The viscosity of FC-C-C was found to be (63.20 \u00b1 0.83) cP.

      "abstract": "Abstract Countless systems in biology, physics, and finance undergo diffusive dynamics. Many of these systems, including biomolecules inside cells, active matter systems and foraging animals, exhibit anomalous dynamics where the growth of the mean squared displacement with time follows a power law with an exponent that deviates from 1. When studying time series recording the evolution of these systems, it is crucial to precisely measure the anomalous exponent and confidently identify the mechanisms responsible for anomalous diffusion. These tasks can be overwhelmingly difficult when only few short trajectories are available, a situation that is common in the study of non-equilibrium and living systems. Here, we present a data-driven method to analyze single anomalous diffusion trajectories employing recurrent neural networks, which we name RANDI. We show that our method can successfully infer the anomalous exponent, identify the type of anomalous diffusion process, and segment the trajectories of systems switching between different behaviors. We benchmark our performance against the state-of-the art techniques for the study of single short trajectories that participated in the Anomalous Diffusion (AnDi) challenge. Our method proved to be the most versatile method, being the only one to consistently rank in the top 3 for all tasks proposed in the AnDi challenge.",

      "abstract": "Abstract Numerous examples for a priori unexpected non-Gaussian behaviour for normal and anomalous diffusion have recently been reported in single-particle tracking experiments. Here, we address the case of non-Gaussian anomalous diffusion in terms of a random-diffusivity mechanism in the presence of power-law correlated fractional Gaussian noise. We study the ergodic properties of this model via examining the ensemble- and time-averaged mean-squared displacements as well as the ergodicity breaking parameter EB quantifying the trajectory-to-trajectory fluctuations of the latter. For long measurement times, interesting crossover behaviour is found as function of the correlation time \u03c4 characterising the diffusivity dynamics. We unveil that at short lag times the EB parameter reaches a universal plateau. The corresponding residual value of EB is shown to depend only on \u03c4 and the trajectory length. The EB parameter at long lag times, however, follows the same power-law scaling as for fractional Brownian motion. We also determine a corresponding plateau at short lag times for the discrete representation of fractional Brownian motion, absent in the continuous-time formulation. These analytical predictions are in excellent agreement with results of computer simulations of the underlying stochastic processes. Our findings can help distinguishing and categorising certain nonergodic and non-Gaussian features of particle displacements, as observed in recent single-particle tracking experiments.",

Although anomaly generation methods have been proposed to augment the anomaly data, they either suffer from poor generation authenticity or inaccurate alignment between the generated anomalies and masks. To address the above problems, we propose AnomalyDiffusion, a novel diffusion-based few-shot anomaly generation model, which utilizes the strong prior information of latent diffusion model learned from large-scale dataset to enhance the generation authenticity under few-shot training data. Firstly, we propose Spatial Anomaly Embedding, which consists of a learnable anomaly embedding and a spatial embedding encoded from an anomaly mask, disentangling the anomaly information into anomaly appearance and location information. Moreover, to improve the alignment between the generated anomalies and the anomaly masks, we introduce a novel Adaptive Attention Re-weighting Mechanism. Based on the disparities between the generated anomaly image and normal sample, it dynamically guides the model to focus more on the areas with less noticeable generated anomalies, enabling generation of accurately-matched anomalous image-mask pairs. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our model significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art methods in generation authenticity and diversity, and effectively improves the performance of downstream anomaly inspection tasks.

This computational infrastructure allows the simulation of hours of molecular machine dynamics in reasonable wall-clock time.

Furthermore, the SRDDM describes the mechanics and kinetics of Ndc80 linkers mediating transient attachments of microtubules to the chromosomal kinetochores. The rates of these attachments and detachments depend upon phosphorylation states of the Ndc80 linkers, which are regulated in the model by explicitly accounting for the reactions of Aurora A and B kinase enzymes undergoing restricted diffusion. We find that there is an optimal rate of microtubule-kinetochore detachments which maximizes the accuracy of the chromosome connections, that adding chromosome arms to kinetochores improve the accuracy by slowing down chromosome movements, that Aurora A and kinetochore deformations have a small positive effect on the attachment accuracy, and that thermal fluctuations of the microtubules increase the rates of kinetochore capture and also improve the accuracy of spindle assembly.",

To this aim, first, we use linear stability analysis techniques to deduce the conditions under which wave (or oscillatory Turing) instability takes place. Then, we apply multiple-scale weakly nonlinear analysis to determine the equation which rules the spatiotemporal evolution of pattern amplitude close to criticality. This investigation leads to a cubic complex Ginzburg-Landau (CCGL) equation which, owing to the functional dependence of the coefficients here involved on the inertial times, reveals some intriguing consequences. To show in detail the richness of such a scenario, we present, as an illustrative example, the pattern dynamics occurring in the hyperbolic generalization of the extended Klausmeier model. This is a simple two-species model used to describe the migration of vegetation stripes along the hillslope of semiarid environments. By means of a thorough comparison between analytical predictions and numerical simulations, we show that inertia, apart from enlarging the region of the parameter plane where wave instability occurs, may also modulate the key features of the coherent structures, solution of the CCGL equation. In particular, it is proven that inertial effects play a role, not only during transient regime from the spatially-homogeneous steady state toward the patterned state, but also in altering the amplitude, the wavelength, the angular frequency, and even the stability of the phase-winding solutions.",

We mapped the OT team dynamics and infection control practices using visual methods to guide reflexive feedback and optimize perioperative practices. Methods: Data were gathered from adult gastrointestinal surgical teams at a tertiary hospital in India using observations, sociograms (communication mapping tool), and focus group discussions (FGDs). Our methods aimed to map team communication, roles and responsibilities in infection-related practices, and door openings. Qualitative data were thematically analyzed. Quantitative data were analyzed using descriptive statistics. Results: Data were gathered from 10 surgical procedures (over 51 hours) using 16 sociograms, 15 traffic flow maps, and 3 FGDs. Senior surgeons directly influence team hierarchies, dynamics, and communication. While the surgeons, anesthetic residents, and technicians lead most tasks during procedures, the scrub nurse acts as a mediator coordinating activity among role players across hierarchies. Failing to provide the scrub nurse with complete details of the planned surgery leads to multiple door openings to fetch equipment and disposables. Traffic flow observed in 15-minute intervals corresponds to a mean frequency of 56 door openings per hour (min: 16; max: 108), with implications for infection control. Implementing the World Health Organization surgical safety checklist was inconsistent across pathways and does not match reported compliance data.

It is worth mentioning that the proposed optimized control is clearly simple since the reinforcement learning (RL) algorithm is derived based on the negative gradient of a simple positive function. Furthermore, the proposed optimal control strategy ensures that all the signals in the closed-loop system are bounded. Finally, a practical simulation example is carried out to further illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed optimal control method.",

      "abstract": "Autonomous optimization refers to the design of feedback controllers that\\nsteer a physical system to a steady state that solves a predefined, possibly\\nconstrained, optimization problem. As such, no exogenous control inputs such as\\nsetpoints or trajectories are required. Instead, these controllers are modeled\\nafter optimization algorithms that take the form of dynamical systems. The\\ninterconnection of this type of optimization dynamics with a physical system is\\nhowever not guaranteed to be stable unless both dynamics act on sufficiently\\ndifferent timescales. In this paper, we quantify the required timescale\\nseparation and give prescriptions that can be directly used in the design of\\nthis type of feedback controllers. Using ideas from singular perturbation\\nanalysis, we derive stability bounds for different feedback laws that are based\\non common continuous-time optimization schemes. In particular, we consider\\ngradient descent and its variations, including projected gradient, and Newton\\ngradient. We further give stability bounds for momentum methods and\\nsaddle-point flows. Finally, we discuss how optimization algorithms like\\nsubgradient and accelerated gradient descent, while well-behaved in offline\\nsettings, are unsuitable for autonomous optimization due to their general lack\\nof robustness.\\n",

      "abstract": "Vehicle platoon control based on vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V) communication is one of the promising technologies to improve the performance of transportation systems. This paper presents a distributed controller to optimize a vehicle platoon's fuel consumption by combining the switching feedback control and economic model predictive control (EMPC) methods. The closed-loop dynamics involving switching feedback gains with the constant time headway (CTH) policy are established firstly, and the multiple-predecessor following (MPF) communication topology is considered. In order to obtain the economy optimal feedback gain, we design a local optimal control problem for each vehicle, based on which the average dwell time is defined and the distributed EMPC algorithm is designed. Based on linear matrix inequalities (LMIs) and the Lyapunov theorem, the feedback gain selection method and the lower bound for average dwell time that guarantees asymptotic stability are analyzed rigorously. Then a modified algorithm that can ensure string stability is designed. Numerical simulations show a maximum of 6.84% fuel benefit compared with pure tracking-oriented methods.",

      "abstract": "This paper addresses the control problem of heterogeneous vehicle platoons subject to disturbances and modeling errors. The objective is to guarantee spatial-geometry constraints of vehicles in a platoon. We deal with the case where a predecessor-leader following (PLF) communication topology is used and heterogeneous vehicle dynamics is subject to disturbances. To estimate the lumped disturbance, the technique of unknown input proportional multiple-integral (PMI) observer is employed such that both the state and the disturbance are simultaneously estimated. Moreover, tube-based model predictive control (TMPC) is used and the corresponding control law is composed of a feed-forward term, a feedback term, and a disturbance compensation term. The gains in the integrated control strategy are optimized by utilizing the particle swarm optimization (PSO) algorithm with an H <sub xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">\u221e</sub> performance index of an augmented error system. It is proved that the deviations between the actual system and the nominal system are bounded in a robustly positively invariant (RPI) set, that is, the main objective is guaranteed. With the proposed control strategy, simulations and comparisons are carried out. We can see that the control performance of the proposed strategy is significantly improved while the computational time is reduced compared with existing methods.",
