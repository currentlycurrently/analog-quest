Taking inspiration from advances in artificial intelligence and their applications in material discovery, we propose a computational method for designing metamorphic DNA-co-polymerized hydrogel structures. The method consists of a coarse-grained simulation and a deep learning-guided optimization system for exploring the immense design space of these structures. Here, we develop a simple numeric simulation of DNA-co-polymerized hydrogel shape change and seek to find designs for structured hydrogels that can fold into the shapes of different Arabic numerals in different actuation states. We train a convolutional neural network to classify and score the geometric outputs of the coarse-grained simulation to provide autonomous feedback for design optimization. We then construct a genetic algorithm that generates and selects large batches of material designs that compete with one another to evolve and converge on optimal objective-matching designs. We show that we are able to explore the large design space and learn important parameters and traits. We identify vital relationships between the material scale size and the range of shape change that can be achieved by individual domains and we elucidate trade-offs between different design parameters. Finally, we discover material designs capable of transforming into multiple different digits in different actuation states.",

      "title": "Educational Design Principles of Using AI Chatbot That Supports Self-Regulated Learning in Education: Goal Setting, Feedback, and Personalization",
      "abstract": "The invention of ChatGPT and generative AI technologies presents educators with significant challenges, as concerns arise regarding students potentially exploiting these tools unethically, misrepresenting their work, or gaining academic merits without active participation in the learning process. To effectively navigate this shift, it is crucial to embrace AI as a contemporary educational trend and establish pedagogical principles for properly utilizing emerging technologies like ChatGPT to promote self-regulation. Rather than suppressing AI-driven tools, educators should foster collaborations among stakeholders, including educators, instructional designers, AI researchers, and developers. This paper proposes three key pedagogical principles for integrating AI chatbots in classrooms, informed by Zimmerman\u2019s Self-Regulated Learning (SRL) framework and Judgment of Learning (JOL). We argue that the current conceptualization of AI chatbots in education is inadequate, so we advocate for the incorporation of goal setting (prompting), self-assessment and feedback, and personalization as three essential educational principles. First, we propose that teaching prompting is important for developing students\u2019 SRL. Second, configuring reverse prompting in the AI chatbot\u2019s capability will help to guide students\u2019 SRL and monitoring for understanding. Third, developing a data-driven mechanism that enables an AI chatbot to provide learning analytics helps learners to reflect on learning and develop SRL strategies. By bringing in Zimmerman\u2019s SRL framework with JOL, we aim to provide educators with guidelines for implementing AI in teaching and learning contexts, with a focus on promoting students\u2019 self-regulation in higher education through AI-assisted pedagogy and instructional design.",

      "abstract": "The virtual synchronous generator (VSG) was proposed to emulate a synchronous machine's dynamics when integrating power electronic converter-based distributed energy resources to the power grid. However, the VSG's synchronization stability during grid faults is not fully explored. The underlying mechanism of loss of synchronization still needs to be further revealed due to VSG's nonlinear characteristics. In this article, a step-by-step analytical method based on combining the linear and nonlinear models is proposed to analyze VSG's dynamic behaviors during a large disturbance. The relationship between the linear and nonlinear models is first brought to light, showing that the linear model is suitable for qualitative analysis to give an intuitive physical insight. Simultaneously, the latter is adopted for quantitative analysis to assess stability after a grid fault. Moreover, to avoid the conflict of the synchronization stability and the inertia response, a transient damping method is added in the active power control loop, which can simultaneously improve the synchronization stability and frequency stability. Design guidelines are also proposed to identify the parameter of the transient damping with different inertia requirements. Finally, the experimental results verify the analytical method and the theoretical analysis.",

      "abstract": "Phase-locked loop (PLL) synchronization instability of grid-connected converters under grid faults is a serious concern, in particular for multiconverter plants/stations connected to a weak grid. The multiconverter interaction can lead a large number of converters to lose stability successively. The PLL synchronization instability of a single-converter system has been well studied previously, but it remains unclear how the multiconverter interaction affects the synchronization stability. This article is aimed to fill this gap, in which multiconverter modeling and interaction analysis, stability level assessment, and stability improvement are addressed. It is found that the interaction is detrimental to the near-end converters, but it is beneficial to the far-end ones. From the most prone-to-instability converter, a simple method is proposed to efficiently assess the synchronization stability level of the entire system. In the aspect of improving synchronization stability, the existing methods are evaluated comparatively, and a simple feedforward-compensated PLL is proposed to address the disadvantage of the existing methods. Among them, recommendations are provided by considering multiple aspects of performance and different application requirements. The performance of the methods is verified by hardware-in-the-loop experiments. The results of this study provide a simple engineering method for grid-connected multiconverter synchronization stability assessment and practical guidelines for the selection of stability improvement methods.",

      "abstract": "The synchronization stability of the virtual synchronous generator (VSG) under grid fault is an important issue for maintaining stable operation in the power system. Existing work has pointed out a low-pass filter (LPF) with a sufficiently low cutoff frequency in the reactive power control loop (RPCL) can improve the transient stability. Yet, the underlying mechanism was unknown. Moreover, as a key index of VSG and precondition of synchronization stability, the frequency response is rarely studied. In this article, based on the linearized model for qualitative analysis, combined with the nonlinear model for quantitative analysis, the underlying mechanism of improving synchronization stability using an LPF in the RPCL is revealed. Furthermore, to avoid increasing the system order and solve the conflict between transient stability and frequency response, an improved synchronization stability method is proposed by feedforwarding the frequency difference between the VSG and grid to the RPCL. The frequency response is also acquired based on the combined linearized and nonlinear model, which shows that the frequency feedforward method can further enhance the frequency stability. How to design the coefficient of the frequency feedforward path with different inertia requirements is also presented. Finally, this method is verified by experimental results.",

In this letter, sufficient conditions of VSG control parameters for transient synchronization stability are derived using Lyapunov direct method. Then, a systematic feasible parameters region is obtained that satisfies grid-code-based transient stability and rate-of-change-of-frequency (RoCoF) requirement under large disturbances.

In the literature, the synchronization stability assessment is carried out considering the dynamics of Phase-Locked Loops (PLL) but the transients of converter currents are neglected. The letter shows that such a simplification leads to inaccuracies and, thus, the current transients cannot be neglected. The letter proposes a model that captures the effect of such current transients on the converter synchronization. This model allows assessing the transient behavior and, hence, the stability, of power electronics converters with high accuracy, comparable, in fact, to EMT models.

      "abstract": "With the increasing penetration of renewable energy generation, grid-forming (GFM) converters that simulate the dynamics of synchronous generator (SG) and actively participate in grid voltage and frequency regulation are increasingly employed. In GFM converter dominated power system, similar transient synchronization stability that is common in conventional power system also exists, which is closely related with the control dynamics of GFM converters. In this paper, the transient synchronization stability of GFM converters with virtual synchronous generator (VSG) control is focused on, with the influence of transient switched operation mode (TSOM) introduced by current saturation limitation considered especially. First, a novel transient equivalent motion model of VSG is developed. The model is a switched system and TSOM significantly changes the power angle characteristics. Based on power angle curve analysis and equal area method, the transient stability analysis is carried out from non-existence of equilibrium point and non-matching of accelerating-decelerating area. Analysis indicates that TSOM imposes another constraint to equilibrium point and reduces deceleration area, which worsens the transient stability. Further, employing the stability region theory of nonlinear dynamic systems, the stability region of VSG is visually displayed in phase plane. It is identified that the TSOM reduces the stability region and worsens the stability. Finally, the influence factors including power reference, grid voltage sag and grid impedance are discussed.",

      "abstract": "In this article, the synchronizing dynamic issue of VSC dominated power system is focused on. First, based on the discovered analogous synchronizing dynamical process of VSC (voltage source converter) and SG (synchronous generator), the dynamics of VSC's PLL (phase locked loop) is modeled in the similar form of SG's rotor motion. The influence of control interaction on PLL is modeled in the same way as that of control dynamics on rotor motion. Then the analogized SG model of PLL-based VSC is developed. Based on the proposed model, the analysis idea jointing accelerating-decelerating area method and numerical simulation is employed to study the transient synchronizing stability of single VSC infinite bus system. It is identified that the influence of ACC (alternating current control) on PLL is to accelerate PLL's equivalent motion in first swing, which aggravates the mismatch of accelerating-decelerating area and thus deteriorates the transient stability. Furtherly, the influence factors including ACC's bandwidth, PLL's bandwidth and current references on the transient stability are studied. This article provides a useful analysis idea for transient synchronizing stability analysis of VSC with influence of control interaction considered.",

      "abstract": "The phase-locked loop (PLL)-caused couplings on the grid-connected converter (GCC) are strengthened by increasing its bandwidth and then incur synchronization instability. This article proposes a constant-coupling-effect-based PLL (CCE\u2013PLL) to resolve the aforementioned issues. Initially, the feature of the PLL-caused couplings on GCC is explored. It exhibits that the couplings are varied along with the PLL bandwidth hence jeopardizing the system's stability. Subsequently, the CCE\u2013PLL with a constant and low coupling regardless of its bandwidth on the GCC is proposed. It illustrates that the CCE\u2013PLL bandwidth does not influence the GCC's impedance response, bringing the GCC and CCE\u2013PLL can be designed separately. Last, the experiments confirm that using CCE\u2013PLL, the system has high robustness against grid impedance variation, and the GCC is capable of injecting/absorbing 1.0 per unit active power in a very weak grid. Moreover, the system attains good anti-interference ability and transient performance under system disturbances thanks to the permission usage of the high CCE\u2013PLL bandwidth.",

      "abstract": "The dc-link voltage dynamics can be directly used to synchronize grid-forming (GFM) converters with ac grids. However, such control scheme is prone to unstable low-frequency oscillations (LFO), owing to the constant-power dynamics at the dc link. This article analyzes first the small-signal stability of dc-link voltage-synchronized GFM converters, and proposes a control method for enhancing the system stability under different operating scenarios. In the approach, a q-axis voltage-feedforward control is introduced in parallel with the dc-link voltage control for the grid-synchronization purpose. The LFO problem with the conventional dc-link voltage-synchronization control is mitigated. Compared to conventional cascaded/paralleled dc-link voltage- and active power-based synchronization, the method mitigates the synchronous oscillation problem. Experimental tests are performed for the GFM converter operating in both rectifier and inverter modes and with different grid strengths. The results corroborate theoretical analyses and validate the effectiveness of the approach.",

      "abstract": "The synchronization dynamics of grid-connected power converters are known to have a tremendous impact on transient stability and fault ride-through performance under grid faults. Up till now, the modeling of converter synchronization stability, which has paved the way for numerous enhanced control methods, is developed around the assumption that the grid fault is symmetrical. However, this is rarely the case. Moreover, grid codes require dual-sequence current injection during asymmetrical faults, which implies that the previously developed models are no longer valid during unbalanced conditions. To address these issues, this article identifies the necessary stability conditions during asymmetrical conditions and presents a quasi-static large-signal reduced-order model of a grid-following converter for analyzing its synchronizing interaction with the external network during symmetrical and asymmetrical grid faults. The modeling approach is developed and tested for three different short-circuit faults: A single line-to-ground fault, a double line-to-ground fault, and a line-to-line fault. The accuracy of the proposed model is verified through detailed simulation studies and experimental tests. Thus, this model can be used to assess the transient synchronization stability of grid-following converters during any type of grid fault, and due to its low-order representation, it may be well applicable for large-scale power system studies.",

      "abstract": "Renewable energy sources (RESs) are highly penetrated in power systems through phase-locked loop (PLL) synchronized converters. Under severe grid voltage sags, PLL-synchronized RES system is susceptive to transient instability and tripping from the grid due to inappropriate current injection. The existing literatures mainly focus on synchronization instability issues of a single grid-connected RES system, and the effect of the interaction between them is rarely studied. To fill this gap, this paper aims to clarify the interaction mechanism and characterize stability boundary of paralleled PLL-synchronized RES system with different converter parameters. More specifically, the effect of current injection angle and magnitude on transient synchronization stability is investigated for guiding current injection reference design during low voltage ride-through (LVRT) and rated capacity option of RESs. First, the transient interaction model of the paralleled converter system is developed, and interaction mechanism under different current injection angles is revealed. Next, stability region analysis is performed to evaluate the impact of current injection magnitude, wherein current injection boundary is obtained. Then, a current injection design method is proposed for improving both transient stability and voltage support. The theoretical analysis and the proposed method are validated by simulation results.",

NNs are used to approximate the unknown internal dynamics, and an adaptive NN state observer is developed to estimate the immeasurable states. By constructing a barrier type of optimal cost functions for subsystems and employing an observer and the actor-critic architecture, the virtual and actual optimal controllers are developed under the framework of backstepping technique. In addition to ensuring the boundedness of all closed-loop signals, the proposed strategy can also guarantee that system states are confined within some preselected compact sets all the time. This is achieved by means of barrier Lyapunov functions which have been successfully applied to various kinds of nonlinear systems such as strict-feedback and pure-feedback dynamics. Besides, our developed optimal controller requires less conditions on system dynamics than some existing approaches concerning optimal control. The effectiveness of the proposed optimal control approach is eventually validated by numerical as well as practical examples.",

The proposed method is capable of reducing the measurement noise in frequencies overlapping with the control bandwidth without affecting the tracking ability of the feedback control system. Moreover, this method is simple in that its noise suppression ability is merely decided by the ${Q}$ -filter, which can be set as a constant. In addition, a necessary and sufficient condition for the system stability is presented considering the uncertainties of the real plant. It is shown that when the ${Q}$ -filter is zero, the uncertainties of the plant cannot influence the stability of the system. To verify the effectiveness, both the tracking performance and noise rejection performance of the proposed method is simulated, comparing with the conventional feedback control system.

Arabidopsis HSC70 chaperones are thought to act as housekeeping chaperones and as such are involved in many growth\u2010related pathways. Whether Arabidopsis HSC70 binds RNA and whether this interaction is functional has remained an open question. We provide evidence that the HSC70.1 chaperone binds its own mRNA via its C\u2010terminal short variable region (SVR) and inhibits its own translation. The SVR encoding mRNA region is necessary for HSC70.1 transcript mobility to distant tissues and that HSC70.1 transcript and not protein mobility is required to rescue root growth and flowering time of hsc70 mutants. We propose that this negative protein\u2010transcript feedback loop may establish an on\u2010demand chaperone pool that allows for a rapid response to stress. In summary, our data suggest that the Arabidopsis HSC70.1 chaperone can form a complex with its own transcript to regulate its translation and that both protein and transcript can act in a noncell\u2010autonomous manner, potentially maintaining chaperone homeostasis between tissues.",

Central to this discussion is the notion that various morphological features, intrinsic factors, diseases, and injuries independently and interactively influence deep body temperature during exercise and/or exposure to hot ambient temperatures. The first sections review fundamental aspects of the human heat stress response, including the biophysical principles governing heat balance and the autonomic control of heat loss thermoeffectors. Next, we discuss the effects of different intrinsic factors (morphology, heat adaptation, biological sex, and age), diseases (neurological, cardiovascular, metabolic, and genetic), and injuries (spinal cord injury, deep burns, and heat stroke), with emphasis on the mechanisms by which these factors enhance or disturb the regulation of deep body temperature during heat stress.

Whether the conventional, rapid, and spatially restricted NVC response can be generalized to deeper and functionally diverse brain regions remains unknown. Implementing an approach for in vivo two-photon imaging from the ventral surface of the brain, we show that a systemic homeostatic challenge, acute salt loading, progressively increases hypothalamic vasopressin (VP) neuronal firing and evokes a vasoconstriction that reduces local blood flow. Vasoconstrictions are blocked by topical application of a VP receptor antagonist or tetrodotoxin, supporting mediation by activity-dependent, dendritically released VP. Salt-induced inverse NVC results in a local hypoxic microenvironment, which evokes positive feedback excitation of VP neurons. Our results reveal a physiological mechanism by which inverse NVC responses regulate systemic homeostasis, further supporting the notion of brain heterogeneity in NVC responses.",

Multiple internal and external signals converge at the regulation of auxin metabolism, intercellular transport, and signaling (Pernisova and Vernoux, 2021; Anfang and Shani, 2021). Considering this complexity, it remains largely unknown how plant cells monitor and ensure the homeostasis of auxin responses. PIN-LIKES (PILS) intracellular auxin transport facilitators at the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) are suitable candidates to buffer cellular auxin responses, because they limit nuclear abundance and signaling of auxin (Barbez et al., 2012; Beziat et al., 2017; Feraru et al., 2019; Sun et al., 2020). We used forward genetics to identify mechanisms that define the PILS6 protein abundance and thereby auxin signaling outputs. We screened for g loomy a nd s hiny p ils ( gasp ) mutants that define the levels of PILS6-GFP under a constitutive promoter. In this study, we show that GASP1 encodes for an uncharacterized RING/U-box superfamily protein and impacts on auxin signaling output. We conclude that the low auxin signaling in gasp1 mutants correlates with reduced abundance of PILS proteins, such as PILS5 and PILS6, which consequently balances auxin-related phenotypes. In agreement, we show that high and low auxin conditions increase and reduce PILS6 protein levels, respectively. Accordingly, non-optimum auxin concentrations are buffered by alterations in PILS6 abundance, consequently leading to homeostatic auxin output regulation. We envision that this feedback mechanism provides robustness to auxin-dependent plant development.",

      "abstract": "The grand challenge to physiology, as was first described in an essay published in the inaugural issue of Frontiers in Physiology in 2010, remains to integrate function from molecules to intact organisms. In order to make sense of the vast volume of information derived from, and increasingly dependent upon, reductionist approaches, a greater emphasis must be placed on the traditional integrated and more holistic approaches developed by the scientists who gave birth to physiology as an intellectual discipline. Our understanding of physiological regulation has evolved over time from the Greek idea of body humors, through Claude Bernard's \"milieu int\u00e9rieur,\" to Walter Cannon's formulation of the concept of \"homeostasis\" and the application of control theory (feedback and feedforward regulation) to explain how a constant internal environment is achieved. Homeostasis has become the central unifying concept of physiology and is defined as a self-regulating process by which an organism can maintain internal stability while adjusting to changing external conditions. Homeostasis is not static and unvarying; it is a dynamic process that can change internal conditions as required to survive external challenges. It is also important to note that homeostatic regulation is not merely the product of a single negative feedback cycle but reflects the complex interaction of multiple feedback systems that can be modified by higher control centers. This hierarchical control and feedback redundancy results in a finer level of control and a greater flexibility that enables the organism to adapt to changing environmental conditions. The health and vitality of the organism can be said to be the end result of homeostatic regulation. An understanding of normal physiology is not possible without an appreciation of this concept. Conversely, it follows that disruption of homeostatic mechanisms is what leads to disease, and effective therapy must be directed toward re-establishing these homeostatic conditions. Therefore, it is the purpose of this essay to describe the evolution of our understanding of homeostasis and the role of physiological regulation and dysregulation in health and disease.",

      "abstract": "Cells must adapt to changes in their environment to maintain cell, tissue and organismal integrity in the face of mechanical, chemical or microbiological stress. Nuclear factor-\u03baB (NF-\u03baB) is one of the most important transcription factors that controls inducible gene expression as cells attempt to restore homeostasis. It plays critical roles in the immune system, from acute inflammation to the development of secondary lymphoid organs, and also has roles in cell survival, proliferation and differentiation. Given its role in such critical processes, NF-\u03baB signalling must be subject to strict spatiotemporal control to ensure measured and context-specific cellular responses. Indeed, deregulation of NF-\u03baB signalling can result in debilitating and even lethal inflammation and also underpins some forms of cancer. In this review, we describe the homeostatic feedback mechanisms that limit and \u2018re-set\u2019 inducible activation of NF-\u03baB. We first describe the key components of the signalling pathways leading to activation of NF-\u03baB, including the prominent role of protein phosphorylation and protein ubiquitylation, before briefly introducing the key features of feedback control mechanisms. We then describe the array of negative feedback loops targeting different components of the NF-\u03baB signalling cascade including controls at the receptor level, post-receptor signalosome complexes, direct regulation of the critical \u2018inhibitor of \u03baB kinases\u2019 (IKKs) and inhibitory feedforward regulation of NF-\u03baB-dependent transcriptional responses. We also review post-transcriptional feedback controls affecting RNA stability and translation. Finally, we describe the deregulation of these feedback controls in human disease and consider how feedback may be a challenge to the efficacy of inhibitors.",

      "title": "Artificial homeostatic temperature regulation via bio-inspired feedback mechanisms",
      "abstract": "Abstract Homeostasis comprises one of the main features of living organisms that enables their robust functioning by adapting to environmental changes. In particular, thermoregulation, as an instance of homeostatic behavior, allows mammals to maintain stable internal temperature with tightly controlled self-regulation independent of external temperatures. This is made by a proper reaction of the thermoeffectors (like skin blood vessels, brown adipose tissue (BAT), etc.) on a wide range of temperature perturbations that reflect themselves in the thermosensitive neurons\u2019 activity. This activity is being delivered to the respective actuation points and translated into thermoeffectors\u2019 actions, which bring the temperature of the organism to the desired level, called a set-point. However, it is still an open question whether these mechanisms can be implemented in an analog electronic device: both on a system theoretical and a hardware level. In this paper, we transfer this control loop into a real electric circuit by designing an analog electronic device for temperature regulation that works following bio-inspired principles. In particular, we construct a simplified single-effector regulation system and show how spiking trains of thermosensitive artificial neurons can be processed to realize an efficient feedback mechanism for the stabilization of the a priori unknown but system-inherent set-point. We also demonstrate that particular values of the set-point and its stability properties result from the interplay between the feedback control gain and activity patterns of thermosensitive artificial neurons, for which, on the one hand, the neuronal interconnections are generally not necessary. On the other hand, we show that such connections can be beneficial for the set-point regulation and hypothesize that the synaptic plasticity in real thermosensitive neuronal ensembles can play a role of an additional control layer empowering the robustness of thermoregulation. The electronic realization of temperature regulation proposed in this paper might be of interest for neuromorphic circuits which are bioinspired by taking the basal principle of homeostasis on board. In this way, a fundamental building block of life would be transferred to electronics and become a milestone for the future of neuromorphic engineering.",

      "abstract": "Cells of the vascular wall are exquisitely sensitive to changes in their mechanical environment. In healthy vessels, mechanical forces regulate signaling and gene expression to direct the remodeling needed for the vessel wall to maintain optimal function. Major diseases of arteries involve maladaptive remodeling with compromised or lost homeostatic mechanisms. Whereas homeostasis invokes negative feedback loops at multiple scales to mediate mechanobiological stability, disease progression often occurs via positive feedback that generates mechanobiological instabilities. In this review, we focus on the cell biology, wall mechanics, and regulatory pathways associated with arterial health and how changes in these processes lead to disease. We discuss how positive feedback loops arise via biomechanical and biochemical means. We conclude that inflammation plays a central role in overriding homeostatic pathways and suggest future directions for addressing therapeutic needs.",

      "abstract": "Abstract Self\u2010adaptation and homeostasis are features that distinguish living systems from artificial materials. Living systems, such as plants or the human eye, integrate positive and negative feedback mechanisms to autonomously manage their thermal, optical, and chemical responses to changing sunlight conditions. However, replicating such sophisticated behavior in artificial devices presents a significant challenge. Herein, an inorganic homeostatic device is proposed that integrates both positive and negative feedback mechanisms for adaptive regulation of optical properties, water chemical potential, and local temperature driven by a dynamic change of photonic colors. This device consists of a mesoporous graded one dimensional (1D) photonic crystal, acting as a temperature\u2010responsive shield, coupled with a photothermal layer. The architecture of the device is designed to harness the temperature\u2010driven vapor sorption into mesoporous to create the feedback. The lateral gradient of the photonic stop band enables achieving dual feedback across multiple wavelengths by simply shifting the light beam's position. In the presence of light, the thermo\u2010optical device is able to either amplify or attenuate the optical absorption, reflectivity, and local temperature and dynamically change its structural colors. The structure and performance of the device are characterized using multiple techniques such as Grazing\u2010Incidence Small\u2010Angle X\u2010ray Scattering and time\u2010resolved hyperspectral microscopy. Importantly, the device is fabricated using solution processing, making it compatible with low\u2010cost manufacturing and paving the way for the development of adaptive and time\u2010programmed systems for applications like thermo\u2010regulating windows, smart filters, programmable meta\u2010surfaces, vapor sensors, or even optical computing.",

      "abstract": "The study of homeostatic equilibrium is a key concern in several fields, from physiology and biology to medicine and biomedical engineering. Control theory approaches can provide effective strategies to model physiological control systems, helping in understanding the dynamics of bio- and physio-logical regulation processes. However, the intrinsic complexity of living systems makes it difficult to identify unified biomodels that can represent a wide variety of physiological systems. In this context, the present work proposes a general framework to model the dynamics and describe the behavior of a wide class of multivariable physiological control systems, from the molecular to the whole-organ scale. The framework adopts a structure based on a closed-loop topology taking into account multiple inputs and outputs and with the negative feedback action intrinsically embedded within the model. The development of such a general model has at least three important repercussions: the first concerns the possibility of better understanding the basic mechanisms common to many physiological systems; the second is to develop a common theoretical framework to enable effective approaches to the analysis and design of synthetic biological control systems; finally, the investigation of the structural properties of the model in a general context, allows a guided and simplified application to specific cases. To this regard, in this paper, the existence, possible uniqueness and stability properties of the homeostatic equilibrium points of the general model are investigated; the theoretical framework is then illustrated through two real-world case-studies: (i) the PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway nonlinear dynamics, a critical regulator of cellular growth, proliferation, and survival; (ii) the control mechanism of the neuromuscular stretch reflex, among the prime triggers implicated in postural control. Results proved the capability of the proposed framework to capture the intricate dynamics of multivariable physiological systems at different scales, highlighting the existence of asymptotically stable homeostatic equilibrium and allowing the study of the impact of transmission delays on the system&#x2019;s stability. At the best of authors&#x2019; knowledge, following the paper Ponsiglione et al. (2023) where monovariable systems where dealt with, the proposed methodology is the first attempt to represent and investigate homeostasis from the molecular up to systemic level by exploiting a unified multivariable biomodeling architecture, which makes it a novel approach to understanding homeostatic control from a broader perspective.",

      "abstract": "Abstract Dimensional engineering of appropriate structure is an effective approach to achieve high\u2010performance electromagnetic (EM) wave absorption for magnetic materials. However, controllable modulation of the material configuration and a comprehensive understanding of the relationship between structure and loss mechanism remain challenging. Herein, magnetic CoNi pentagonal nanopagodas (PNPs) are ingeniously tailored using a competition orientation strategy, in which high\u2010density PNPs with sharp corners/edges and hierarchical structure are rooted in situ on the surface of CoNi alloy microsphere. This unique configuration of PNPs originates from the orientation growth of CoNi fivefold twins, which can be effectively regulated by manipulating metal ratio and evolves into flake\u2010, serrated thorn\u2010, prismoid\u2010, and blocks\u2010like morphologies. Optimized CoNi microspheres with high\u2010density PNPs exhibit a broad absorption bandwidth of 6.82 GHz at only 1.8 mm thickness. Cross\u2010scale magnetic coupling networks strengthen magnetic loss ability, magnetocrystalline defects induce dielectric polarization enhancement, which are intuitively confirmed by Lorentz off\u2010axis electron holography and geometric phase analysis. The underlying mechanism of enhanced magnetic interaction in sharp structure is clearly deciphered by micromagnetic simulation.

In particular, EPs, and the collective oscillations driven by EPs, act as mediators of cross-scale couplings among the rich spatiotemporal scales characterizing burning plasmas. In this work, taking the well-known toroidal Alfv\u00e9n eigenmode (TAE) as example, it is shown that meso-scale TAE can interact with micro-scale drift wave turbulence (DW) via both direct and in-direct channels. Three examples of cross-scale couplings among TAEs and DWs are given, including, (1) TAE instabilities can be effectively reduced or even suppressed by ambient stationary DW due to stimulated absorption via direct-scatterings into short-wavelength electron Landau damped kinetic Alfv\u00e9n waves (KAWs); (2) in the \u201creverse\u201d process of DW scattering by ambient stationary TAEs with typical amplitude expected in tokamak experiment, direct nonlinear scatterings to short-wavelength KAWs have a negligible damping effect on DW due to the cancellation of stimulated absorption via the upper-sideband KAW and spontaneous emission via the lower-sideband KAW; and (3) TAE can indirectly regulate the DW intensity via the nonlinearly excited zonal structures, which, in the local limit, yield an unexpected weak destabilizing effect, contrary to usual speculations. These findings illuminate the richness and complexity of nonlinear plasma physics that underlying these processes, required for extrapolating to future reactor burning plasmas.

In this work, we present (1) a simple method to disentangle multi-scale graph convolutions and (2) a unified spatial-temporal graph convolutional operator named G3D. The proposed multi-scale aggregation scheme disentangles the importance of nodes in different neighborhoods for effective long-range modeling. The proposed G3D module leverages dense cross-spacetime edges as skip connections for direct information propagation across the spatial-temporal graph.

      "abstract": "The Nezamabad Fault System (NFS) in the Fars area of the Zagros Fold\u2013Thrust Belt represents a persistent, basement-rooted transverse shear zone that fundamentally controls the regional hydrocarbon system. This study integrates seismicity distribution, isopach analysis, and tectono-stratigraphic modeling from the Triassic to the Cenozoic to unravel how recurrent basement reactivation governs trap evolution. Isopach maps reveal a pronounced southwest-thickening asymmetry, with Triassic successions exceeding 1400 m, indicating long-term differential subsidence during four key phases: (1) Triassic syn-rift salt accumulation (Dashtak Formation) forming the primary detachment; (2) Jurassic\u2013Early Cretaceous passive subsidence promoting source rock deposition; (3) Mid-Cretaceous transpression enhancing reservoir dolomitization; and (4) Late Cretaceous\u2013Cenozoic inversion generating hybrid traps. Seismicity analysis of over 240 events confirms the 256-km-long NFS is a crustal-scale structure, with most foci at 10\u201333 km depth and others extending to 150 km, implying lithospheric stress transfer. This deep-crustal activity has periodically reorganized stress, enhanced fracture permeability, and rejuvenated traps through seismic pumping and cross-scale mechanical coupling. The results demonstrate that hydrocarbons in the Fars area are not a passive outcome of folding but a dynamic expression of lithospheric coupling. The findings establish a predictive framework for identifying analogous basement-influenced petroleum systems in other foreland fold\u2013thrust belts worldwide.",

      "abstract": "Heterogeneous catalysis is at the heart of the chemical industry. Being able to tune and design efficient catalysts for processes of interest is of the utmost importance, and for this, a molecular-level understanding of heterogeneous catalysts is the first step and indeed a prime focus of modern catalysis research. For a long time, the single most thermodynamically stable structure of the catalytic interface attained under the reaction conditions had been envisioned as the reactive phase. However, some catalytic interfaces continue to undergo structural dynamics in the steady state, triggered by high temperatures and pressures and binding and changing reagents. Among particularly dynamic interfaces are such widely used catalysts as crystalline and amorphous surfaced supporting (sub)nanometallic clusters. Recently, it became clear that this dynamic fluxionality causes the supported clusters to populate many distinct structural and stoichiometric states under catalytic conditions. Hence, the catalytic interface should be viewed as an evolving statistical ensemble of many structures (rather than one structure). Every member in the ensemble contributes to the properties of the catalyst differently, in proportion to its probability of being populated. This new notion flips the established paradigm and calls for a new theory, new modeling approaches, <i>operando</i> measurements, and updated design strategies. The statistical ensemble nature of surface-supported subnanocluster catalysts can be exemplified by oxide-supported and adsorbate-covered Pt, Pd, Cu, and CuPd clusters, which are catalytic toward oxidative and nonoxidative dehydrogenation. They have access to a variety of 3D and quasi-2D shapes. The compositions of their thermal ensembles are dependent on the cluster size, leading to size-specific catalytic activities and the famous \"every atom counts\" phenomenon. The support and adsorbates affect catalyst structures, and the state of the reacting species causes the ensemble to change in every reaction intermediate. The most stable member of the ensemble dominates the thermodynamic properties of the corresponding intermediate, whereas the kinetics can be determined by more active but less populated metastable catalyst states, and that suggests that many earlier studies might have overlooked the actual active sites. Both effects depend on the relative time scales of catalyst restructuring and reaction dynamics. The catalyst may routinely operate off-equilibrium. Ensemble phenomena lead to surprising exceptions from established rules of catalysis, such as scaling relations and Arrhenius behavior. Catalyst deactivation is also an ensemble property, and its extent of mitigation can be predicted through the new paradigm. These findings were enabled by advances in theory, such as global optimization and subsequent utilization of multiple local minima and pathways sampling as well as <i>operando</i> catalyst characterization. The fact that the per-site and per-species resolution is needed for the description and prediction of catalyst properties gives theory the central role in catalysis research, as most experiments provide ensemble-average information and cannot detect the crucial minority species that may be responsible for the catalytic activity.",

Such states are typically formed through phase transitions under non-equilibrium conditions and the final state is reached through processes that span a large range of timescales. Conventionally, phase diagrams of materials are thought of as static, without temporal evolution. However, many functional properties of materials arise as a result of complex temporal changes in the material occurring on different timescales. Hitherto, such properties were not considered within the context of a temporally-evolving phase diagram, even though, under non-equilibrium conditions, different phases typically evolve on different timescales. Here, by using time-resolved optical techniques and femtosecond-pulse-excited scanning tunneling microscopy (STM), we track the evolution of the metastable states in a material that has been of wide recent interest, the quasi-two-dimensional dichalcogenide 1 T -TaS 2 . We map out its temporal phase diagram using the photon density and temperature as control parameters on timescales ranging from 10 \u221212 to 10 3 s. The introduction of a time-domain axis in the phase diagram enables us to follow the evolution of metastable emergent states created by different phase transition mechanisms on different timescales, thus enabling comparison with theoretical predictions of the phase diagram, and opening the way to understanding of the complex ordering processes in metastable materials.",

Because many metastable states may coexist, it remains challenging to predict binding sites through molecular docking simulations using available computational pipelines. In this study, we used independent simulations to broaden the conformational diversity sampled from DNA initial models of distinct stability and assessed the binding affinity of selected metastable representative structures. In our results, utilizing multiple metastable conformations for molecular docking analysis helped identify structures favorable for ligand binding and accurately predict the binding sites. Our workflow was able to correctly identify the binding sites of the characterized adenosine monophosphate and l-argininamide aptamers.

      "abstract": "We study a one-dimensional disordered Bose fluid using bosonization, the replica method, and a nonperturbative functional renormalization-group approach. We find that the Bose-glass phase is described by a fully attractive strong-disorder fixed point characterized by a singular disorder correlator whose functional dependence assumes a cuspy form that is related to the existence of metastable states. At nonzero momentum scale k, quantum tunneling between the ground state and low-lying metastable states leads to a rounding of the cusp singularity into a quantum boundary layer (QBL). The width of the QBL depends on an effective Luttinger parameter K_{k}\u223ck^{\u03b8} that vanishes with an exponent \u03b8=z-1 related to the dynamical critical exponent z. The QBL encodes the existence of rare \"superfluid\" regions, controls the low-energy dynamics, and yields a (dissipative) conductivity vanishing as \u03c9^{2} in the low-frequency limit. These results reveal the glassy properties (pinning, \"shocks,\" or static avalanches) of the Bose-glass phase and can be understood within the \"droplet\" picture put forward for the description of glassy (classical) systems.",

      "abstract": "Abstract A unique feature of metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) in contrast to rigid nanoporous materials is their structural switchabilty offering a wide range of functionality for sustainable energy storage, separation and sensing applications. This has initiated a series of experimental and theoretical studies predominantly aiming at understanding the thermodynamic conditions to transform and release gas, but the nature of sorption-induced switching transitions remains poorly understood. Here we report experimental evidence for fluid metastability and history-dependent states during sorption triggering the structural change of the framework and leading to the counterintuitive phenomenon of negative gas adsorption (NGA) in flexible MOFs. Preparation of two isoreticular MOFs differing by structural flexibility and performing direct in situ diffusion studies aided by in situ X-ray diffraction, scanning electron microscopy and computational modelling, allowed assessment of n -butane molecular dynamics, phase state, and the framework response to obtain a microscopic picture for each step of the sorption process.",

      "abstract": "Abstract The control of Covid 19 epidemics by public health policy in Italy during the first and the second epidemic waves has been driven by using reproductive number R t (t) to identify the supercritical (percolative), the subcritical (arrested), separated by the critical regime. Here we show that to quantify the Covid-19 spreading rate with containment measures there is a need of a 3D expanded parameter space phase diagram built by the combination of R t (t) and doubling time T d (t). In this space we identify the Covid-19 dynamics in Italy and its administrative Regions. The supercritical regime is mathematically characterized by (i) the power law of T d vs. [R t (t) \u2212 1] and (ii) the exponential behaviour of T d vs. time, either in the first and in the second wave. The novel 3D phase diagram shows clearly metastable states appearing before and after the second wave critical regime. for loosening quarantine and tracing of actives cases. The metastable states are precursors of the abrupt onset of a next nascent wave supercritical regime.

      "abstract": "Abstract Anthocyanins are essential for the quality of perennial horticultural crops, such as grapes. In grapes, ELONGATED HYPOCOTYL 5 (HY5) and MYBA1 are two critical transcription factors that regulate anthocyanin biosynthesis. Our previous work has shown that Vitis vinifera B-box protein 44 (VvBBX44) inhibits anthocyanin synthesis and represses VvHY5 expression in grape calli. However, the regulatory mechanism underlying this regulation was unclear. In this study, we found that loss of VvBBX44 function resulted in increased anthocyanin accumulation in grapevine callus. VvBBX44 directly represses VvMYBA1, which activates VvBBX44. VvMYBA1, but not VvBBX44, directly modulates the expression of grape UDP flavonoid 3-O-glucosyltransferase (VvUFGT). We demonstrated that VvBBX44 represses the transcriptional activation of VvUFGT and VvBBX44 induced by VvMYBA1. However, VvBBX44 and VvMYBA1 did not physically interact in yeast. The application of exogenous anthocyanin stimulated VvBBX44 expression in grapevine suspension cells and tobacco leaves. These findings suggest that VvBBX44 and VvMYBA1 form a transcriptional feedback loop to prevent overaccumulation of anthocyanin and reduce metabolic costs. Our work sheds light on the complex regulatory network that controls anthocyanin biosynthesis in grapevine.",

Here, we study their representative DipM, a factor promoting cell division in Caulobacter crescentus . We show that the LytM domain of DipM interacts with multiple autolysins, including the soluble lytic transglycosylases SdpA and SdpB, the amidase AmiC and the putative carboxypeptidase CrbA, and stimulates the activities of SdpA and AmiC. Its crystal structure reveals a conserved groove, which is predicted to represent the docking site for autolysins by modeling studies.

      "abstract": "The controlled binding of the catalytically dead CRISPR nuclease (dCas) to DNA can be used to create complex, programmable transcriptional genetic circuits, a fundamental goal of synthetic biology. This approach, called CRISPR interference (CRISPRi), is advantageous over existing methods because the programmable nature of CRISPR proteins in principle enables the simultaneous regulation of many different targets without crosstalk. However, the performance of dCas-based genetic circuits is limited by both the sensitivity to leaky repression within CRISPRi logic gates and retroactive effects due to a shared pool of dCas proteins. By utilizing antisense RNAs (asRNAs) to sequester gRNA transcripts as well as CRISPRi feedback to self-regulate asRNA production, we demonstrate a mechanism that suppresses unwanted repression by CRISPRi and improves logical gene circuit function in <i>Escherichia coli</i>. This improvement is particularly pronounced during stationary expression when CRISPRi circuits do not achieve the expected regulatory dynamics. Furthermore, the use of dual CRISPRi/asRNA inverters restores the logical performance of layered circuits such as a double inverter. By studying circuit induction at the single-cell level in microfluidic channels, we provide insight into the dynamics of antisense sequestration of gRNA and regulatory feedback on dCas-based repression and derepression. These results demonstrate how CRISPRi inverters can be improved for use in more complex genetic circuitry without sacrificing the programmability and orthogonality of dCas proteins.",

      "abstract": "Mitochondrial RNA splicing 2 (MRS2) forms a magnesium (Mg 2+ ) entry protein channel in mitochondria. Whereas MRS2 contains two transmembrane domains constituting a pore on the inner mitochondrial membrane, most of the protein resides within the matrix. Yet, the precise structural and functional role of this obtrusive amino terminal domain (NTD) in human MRS2 is unknown. Here, we show that the MRS2 NTD self-associates into a homodimer, contrasting the pentameric assembly of CorA, an orthologous bacterial channel. Mg 2+ and calcium suppress lower and higher order oligomerization of MRS2 NTD, whereas cobalt has no effect on the NTD but disassembles full-length MRS2. Mutating-pinpointed residues-mediating Mg 2+ binding to the NTD not only selectively decreases Mg 2+ -binding affinity \u223csevenfold but also abrogates Mg 2+ binding\u2013induced secondary, tertiary, and quaternary structure changes. Disruption of NTD Mg 2+ binding strikingly potentiates mitochondrial Mg 2+ uptake in WT and Mrs2 knockout cells.

      "abstract": "ABSTRACT Cold stress can limit the growth and development of grapevines, which can ultimately reduce productivity. However, the mechanisms by which grapevines respond to cold stress are not yet fully understood. Here, we characterized an APETALA2/ethylene response factor (AP2/ERF) which was shown to be a target gene of our previously identified VaMYB4a from Amur grape. We further investigated the molecular interactions between VaMYB4a and VaERF054\u2010like transcription factors in grapes and their role in cold stress tolerance. Our results demonstrated that VaMYB4a directly binds to and activates the VaERF054\u2010like gene promoter, leading to its enhanced expression. Moreover, we also explored the influence of ethylene precursors and inhibitors on VaERF054\u2010like expression and grape cold tolerance. Our findings indicate that VaERF054\u2010like contribute to cold tolerance in grapes through modulation of the ethylene pathway and the CBF signal pathway. Overexpression of VaERF054\u2010like in Vitis vinifera \u2018Chardonnay\u2019 calli and transgenic grape lines resulted in increased freezing stress tolerance, confirming its role in the cold stress response. We further confirmed the interaction between VaMYB4a and VaERF054\u2010like in vivo and in vitro. The co\u2010transformation of VaMYB4a and VaERF054 \u2010like in grape calli demonstrates a synergistic interaction, enhancing the cold tolerance through a regulatory feedback mechanism.

      "abstract": "Abstract One of the major pathological hallmarks of Alzheimer\u00b4s disease (AD) is an accumulation of amyloid\u2010\u03b2 (A\u03b2) in brain tissue leading to formation of toxic oligomers and senile plaques. Under physiological conditions, a tightly balanced equilibrium between A\u03b2\u2010production and \u2010degradation is necessary to prevent pathological A\u03b2\u2010accumulation. Here, we investigate the molecular mechanism how insulin\u2010degrading enzyme (IDE), one of the major A\u03b2\u2010degrading enzymes, is regulated and how amyloid precursor protein (APP) processing and A\u03b2\u2010degradation is linked in a regulatory cycle to achieve this balance. In absence of A\u03b2\u2010production caused by APP or Presenilin deficiency, IDE\u2010mediated A\u03b2\u2010degradation was decreased, accompanied by a decreased IDE activity, protein level, and expression. Similar results were obtained in cells only expressing a truncated APP, lacking the APP intracellular domain (AICD) suggesting that AICD promotes IDE expression. In return, APP overexpression mediated an increased IDE expression, comparable results were obtained with cells overexpressing C50, a truncated APP representing AICD. Beside these genetic approaches, also AICD peptide incubation and pharmacological inhibition of the \u03b3\u2010secretase preventing AICD production regulated IDE expression and promoter activity. By utilizing CRISPR/Cas9 APP and Presenilin knockout SH\u2010SY5Y cells results were confirmed in a second cell line in addition to mouse embryonic fibroblasts. In vivo, IDE expression was decreased in mouse brains devoid of APP or AICD, which was in line with a significant correlation of APP expression level and IDE expression in human postmortem AD brains. Our results show a tight link between A\u03b2\u2010production and A\u03b2\u2010degradation forming a regulatory cycle in which AICD promotes A\u03b2\u2010degradation via IDE and IDE itself limits its own production by degrading AICD.",

Previous numerical simulations on reaction\u2010diffusion models of Dpp gradients in Drosophila wing imaginal disc have showed that feedback (of the Hill function type) on (signaling) receptors and/or non\u2010(signaling) receptors are of limited effectiveness in promoting robustness. Spatial nonuniformity of the feedback processes has also been shown theoretically to lead to serious shape distortion and a principal cause for ineffectiveness.

      "title": "Performance feedback and organizational learning: the role of regulatory focus",
      "abstract": "Purpose This study investigates how a firm's regulatory focus (i.e. promotion and prevention foci) affects growth- and efficiency-oriented strategic change, highlighting the role of organizational-level regulatory focus as a cognitive frame within which to interpret performance feedback and its subsequent effects on strategic decisions. Design/methodology/approach The authors collected longitudinal data on 98 S&amp;P 500 manufacturing firms for a seven-year period. The panel data, which includes texts from the firms' 10-K filings, were then analyzed using a feasible generalized least squares (FGLS) regression estimator to test the authors\u2019 hypotheses. Findings A firm's strategic change orientation is affected by its regulatory focus and performance feedback: a promotion focus increases the magnitude of growth-oriented strategic change, while a prevention focus favors efficiency-oriented strategic change. Furthermore, both foci moderate the effect of performance feedback on the strategic change orientation: under negative performance feedback, a promotion (prevention) focus increases (decreases) the magnitude of growth-oriented strategic change relative to that of efficiency-oriented change. The findings provide robust evidence that regulatory focus can influence how organizations learn from feedback and formulate strategic change. Research limitations/implications The authors\u2019 examination of regulatory focus and organizational learning process relied on large manufacturing firms in the USA. However, learning process could be quite different in small and/or young firms. Future work should expand to a wider range of organizational types, such as nascent entrepreneurial ventures. In addition, the authors\u2019 measurement of regulatory focus using corporate text has inherent weakness and could be supplemented with alternative research methods, such as surveys, interviews or experiments. All in all, however, the findings of this study offer a novel behavioral perspective while demonstrating that a regulatory focus is an important antecedent of organizational learning. Practical implications This study highlights the importance of motivational characteristics of the top managers in the process of organizational learning from performance feedback. Furthermore, recruitment of a new top manager should be aligned with the organizational context, values and goals. In addition, corporate governance systems such as managerial compensation schemes need to be carefully designed so as to maximize organizational resilience, especially in the context of performance downturn or environmental change. Establishing a constructive organizational culture so that strategic decisions are not overly swayed by the performance outcomes would also be crucial to the organizational learning process. Social implications This study highlights the importance of understanding the motivational orientations of top managers in organizational learning. In terms of managerial compensation, for instance, an optimal incentive system should reflect the desired performance output by encouraging managerial behavior that corresponds to its objective. Furthermore, motivational orientation of new recruits should be considered in the context of the composition of the top management team members in order to achieve \u201coptimal fit.\u201d In addition, this study suggests that top executives' regulatory focus can be a key factor for organizations in balancing goals of different value orientations. Originality/value The findings of this study demonstrated that a firm-level regulatory focus has a significant effect on organizational learning and strategic change following performance feedback. The authors hope this study provides an impetus for future discussions on the microcognitive mechanisms of organizational learning by exploring the relations between organizations' regulatory foci, performance feedback and strategic change orientations.",

      "abstract": "Active matter refers to the nonequilibrium system composed of interacting units that continually dissipate energy at a single-unit level and transduce it into mechanical force or motion. Such systems are ubiquitous in nature and span most of the biological scales, ranging from cytoskeleton protein polymers at the molecular level to bacterial colonies at the cellular level to swarms of insects, flocks of birds, schools of fish, and even crowds of humans on the organismal scale. The consumption of energy within systems tends to induce the self-organization of active matter as well as the spontaneous emergence of dynamic, complex, and collective states with extraordinary properties, such as adaptability, reconfigurability, taxis, and so on. The research into active matter is expected to deepen the understanding of the underlying mechanisms of how the units in living systems interact with each other and regulate the flow of energy to improve the survival efficiency, which in turn can provide valuable insights into the engineering of artificial active systems with novel and practical collective functionalities.Because of the striking similarity in collective states, a colloidal system is an emerging approach to understanding the guiding principles of the coordinated activities in living systems. Thanks to the capabilities in batch fabrication, size control, and the modulation of interactions (e.g., dipole-dipole interactions, capillary forces, electrostatic interactions, and so on), various complex collective states have been reproduced and programmed in colloidal suspension through the elaborate design of compositions and unit-unit interactions. Among the developed colloidal systems, magnetic colloids energized by alternating magnetic fields demonstrate several unique advantages, including the high-degree-of-freedom and simple modulation of the magnetic field parameters as well as the excellent compatibility of the magnetic field with many application scenarios. Therefore, magnetic active matter not only constitutes a useful platform that leads to a discovery of fascinating emergent collective behaviors but also promises enormous potential in a variety of engineering fields.In this Account, we summarize and highlight the key efforts carried out by our group and others on the investigation of the collective behavior of magnetic active matter in the past 5 years. First, we elucidate the generation mechanisms of the emergent coordinated behaviors, which are classified according to the dominating interactions among agents, that is, the magnetic dipole-dipole interaction, hydrodynamic interaction, and weak interaction. Then we illustrate the construction of magnetic active matter with a higher level of collective effects and functionalities (e.g., reconfigurability, environmental adaptability, 3D swarming, cooperative multifunctionality, and so on) via the synergistic effects between magnetic fields and other fields. Next, potential applications of magnetic active matter are discussed, which mainly focus on the exploration in revolutionizing traditional biomedical fields. Finally, an outlook of future opportunities is presented to promote the development of magnetic active matter, which facilitates a better understanding of living counterparts and the further realization of practical applications.",

      "abstract": "The challenge for a psychology of crowds and collective behavior is to explain how large numbers of people are, spontaneously, able to act together in patterned and socially meaningful ways and, at the same time, how crowd events can bring about social and psychological change. Classical theories, which treat crowd psychology as pathological, deny any meaning to crowd action. More recent normative and rationalist models begin to explain the coherence of crowd action but are unable to explain how that links to broader social systems of meaning. In both cases, the explanatory impasse derives from an individualistic conception of selfhood that denies any social basis to behavioral control. Such a basis is provided by the social identity approach. This proposes that crowd formation is underpinned by the development of shared social identity whereby people see themselves and others in terms of membership of a common category. This leads to three psychological transformations: members perceive the world in terms of collective values and belief systems; they coordinate themselves effectively; and hence they are empowered to realize their collective goals. These transformations explain the social form of crowd action. At the same time, crowd events are intergroup phenomena. It is through the intergroup dynamics between the crowd and an out-group (typically the police)\u2014more specifically the way the social position of crowd members can change through the way police officers understand and respond to their actions\u2014that change can occur. The social identity framework helps make sense of a range of phenomena beyond conflict crowds, including behavior in emergencies and disasters and the psychology of mass gatherings. The practical adequacy of the social identity approach is demonstrated by its use in a number of applied fields, including \u201cpublic order\u201d policing, crowd and emergency management, mass gatherings, health, and pedestrian modeling.",

      "abstract": "We derive a general lower bound on distributions of entropy production in interacting active matter systems. The bound is tight in the limit that interparticle correlations are small and short-ranged, which we explore in four canonical active matter models. In all models studied, the bound is weak where collective fluctuations result in long-ranged correlations, which subsequently links the locations of phase transitions to enhanced entropy production fluctuations. We develop a theory for the onset of enhanced fluctuations and relate it to specific phase transitions in active Brownian particles. We also derive optimal control forces that realize the dynamics necessary to tune dissipation and manipulate the system between phases. In so doing, we uncover a general relationship between entropy production and pattern formation in active matter, as well as ways of controlling it.",

      "abstract": "Humans are a hyper-social species, which greatly impacts the spread of infectious diseases. How do social dynamics impact epidemiology and what are the implications for public health policy? Here, we develop a model of disease transmission that incorporates social dynamics and a behavior that reduces the spread of disease, a voluntary nonpharmaceutical intervention (NPI). We use a \u201ctipping-point\u201d dynamic, previously used in the sociological literature, where individuals adopt a behavior given a sufficient prevalence of the behavior in the population. The thresholds at which individuals adopt the NPI behavior are modulated by the perceived risk of infection, i.e., the disease prevalence and transmission rate, costs to adopt the NPI behavior, and the behavior of others. Social conformity creates a type of \u201cstickiness\u201d whereby individuals are resistant to changing their behavior due to the population\u2019s inertia. In this model, we observe a nonmonotonicity in the attack rate as a function of various biological and social parameters such as the transmission rate, efficacy of the NPI, costs of the NPI, weight of social consequences of shirking the social norm, and the degree of heterogeneity in the population. We also observe that the attack rate can be highly sensitive to these parameters due to abrupt shifts in the collective behavior of the population. These results highlight the complex interplay between the dynamics of epidemics and norm-driven collective behaviors.",

      "title": "Goals and Limitations of Modeling Collective Behavior in Biological Systems",
      "abstract": "Local social interactions among individuals in animal groups generate collective behavior, allowing groups to adjust to changing conditions. Historically, scientists from different disciplines have taken different approaches to modeling collective behavior. We describe how each can contribute to the goal of understanding natural systems. Simple bottom-up models that describe individuals and their interactions directly have demonstrated that local interactions far from equilibrium can generate collective states. However, such simple models are not likely to describe accurately the actual mechanisms and interactions in play in any real biological system. Other classes of top-down models that describe group-level behavior directly have been proposed for groups where the function of the collective behavior is understood. Such models cannot necessarily explain why or how such functions emerge from first principles. Because modeling approaches have different strengths and weaknesses and no single approach will always be best, we argue that models of collective behavior that are aimed at understanding real biological systems should be formulated to address specific questions and to allow for validation. As examples, we discuss four forms of collective behavior that differ both in the interactions that produce the collective behavior and in ecological context, and thus require very different modeling frameworks. 1) Harvester ants use local interactions consisting of brief antennal contact, in which one ant assesses the cuticular hydrocarbon profile of another, to regulate foraging activity, which can be modeled as a closed-loop excitable system. 2) Arboreal turtle ants form trail networks in the canopy of the tropical forest, using trail pheromone; one ant detects the volatile chemical that another has recently deposited. The process that maintains and repairs the trail, which can be modeled as a distributed algorithm, is constrained by the physical configuration of the network of vegetation in which they travel. 3) Swarms of midges interact acoustically and non-locally, and can be well described as agents moving in an emergent potential well that is representative of the swarm as a whole rather than individuals. 4) Flocks of jackdaws change their effective interactions depending on ecological context, using topological distance when traveling but metric distance when mobbing. We discuss how different research questions about these systems have led to different modeling approaches.",

In this paper, we show that in strained polar transition-metal dichalcogenides (TMDs) with 2H structures, Berry-curvature dipoles created by spin degrees of freedom lead to strong nonlinear Hall effects. Under an easily accessible uniaxial strain of order 0.2%, strong nonlinear Hall signals, characterized by a Berry-curvature dipole on the order of 1 angstrom, arise in electron-doped polar TMDs such as MoSSe, and this is easily detectable experimentally. Moreover, the magnitude and sign of the nonlinear Hall current can be easily tuned by electric gating and strain. These properties can be used to distinguish nonlinear Hall effects from classical mechanisms such as ratchet effects. Importantly, our system provides a potential scheme for building electrically switchable energy-harvesting rectifiers.",

Despite their interest for applications, the knowledge about pressure-driven phase transitions of cadmium compounds is still limited. In this paper, we fill this gap and provide an accurate description of the structural evolution of CdPS3 by combining high-pressure experiments and first-principle calculations. We have performed high-throughput screening of the low-energy stacking configurations and found a phase evolution starting with C2/m space group at 12 GPa using the generalized evolutionary metadynamics method. Then, high-pressure experiments have been used to reveal a structural transition from phase-I (C2/m) to phase-II (R3\u00af) to phase-III (R3\u00af), which is marked by the appearance and vanishing of the Raman band at approximately 30\u2013250 cm\u22121 in good agreement with our theoretical predictions.

This mass region consists of complex many-body systems that can behave in astonishingly simple and regular ways, as classified in the Casten symmetry triangle. By applying the shell model Hamiltonian proposed recently, we carry out calculations using the Hartree-Fock-Bogolyubov plus generator coordinate method, in the large model space containing the (1g_{9/2},1g_{7/2},2d_{5/2},2d_{3/2},3s_{1/2},1h_{11/2},2f_{7/2}) orbits. Based on good reproduction of the experimentally known energy levels, spectroscopic quadrupole moments, and E2 transition probabilities, we identify the quasi-SU(3) couplings across the N=50 and 82 shell gaps, which play a role in driving shape evolution and phase transition discussed in the extended Casten triangle. Specifically, we demonstrate that the quasi-SU(3) coupling mechanism in the proton partner orbits (1g_{9/2}, 2d_{5/2}) tends to drive the system to be more \u03b3 soft, and that in the neutron partner orbits (1h_{11/2}, 2f_{7/2}) are responsible for the oblate-to-prolate shape phase transition. With an emphasis on discussing spectroscopic quadrupole moments, our Letter uncovers hidden symmetries from the vast shell-model configurations and adds microscopical insights into the empirical symmetry triangle.",

We find that the system at T=0 exhibits a discontinuous, first-order like phase transition from the incoherent to the fully coherent state; when thermal noise is present (T&amp;gt;0), the transition from incoherence to the partial coherence is continuous and the critical threshold is now larger compared to the deterministic case (T=0). We derive an exact formula for the critical transition from incoherent to coherent oscillations for the deterministic and stochastic case based on both stability analysis for finite oscillators as well as for the thermodynamic limit (N\u2192\u221e) based on a rigorous mean-field theory using graphons, valid for heterogeneous graph structures. Our theoretical results are supported by extensive numerical simulations.

A detailed understanding of the electronic structure of these VHss is therefore essential for an accurate description of such instabilities. Here, we study the low-energy electronic structure of the trilayer strontium ruthenate Sr 4 Ru 3 O 10 , identifying a rich hierarchy of VHss using angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy and millikelvin scanning tunneling microscopy. Comparison of k -resolved electron spectroscopy and quasiparticle interference allows us to determine the structure of the VHss and demonstrate the crucial role of spin-orbit coupling in shaping them.

      "abstract": "Organic-inorganic hybrid metal-halide perovskite (OIHP) materials provide a tunable platform for engineering their optoelectronic properties. Although several high-pressure studies have been conducted from the OIHP family of single crystals and films, the exact nature of the dynamic coupling of the CH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;NH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; (MA) cation with the octahedral lattice framework and the mechanisms responsible for the structural phase transformation under pressure are not well captured. By combined photoluminescence (PL), synchrotron-based x-ray diffraction, and Raman-scattering studies as a function of pressure from methylammonium lead bromide (MAPbBr&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;), we shed light on an isostructural phase transition due to the coupling of the MA cation and the PbBr&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt; lattice through hydrogen bonding. The sharp discontinuities at ~ 1 GPa and ~ 3 GPa in the PL peak positions correlate with the structural changes observed in high-pressure XRD and Raman-scattering studies. The electronic band edge as a function of pressure is calculated within density-functional theory. The PL peak position, intensity and width of the excitonic peak show significant changes at 2 GPa, which corroborate the changes observed in high-pressure Raman-scattering studies. The frequencies of the lattice modes and the C-H/N-H bending and stretching modes of the MA cation show anomalous changes and other nuances at 2 GPa. The suppression of rotational and orientational disorder of the organic moiety is initiated at 2 GPa and the ordering is completed by 3.0 GPa, leading to an order-disorder type cubic II (Im$\\\\overline{3}$) to orthorhombic (&lt;em&gt;Pnma&lt;/em&gt;) phase transition.

      "abstract": "Abstract The structure and valence transitions in multi\u2010valent transition metal oxides are closely associated with the intrinsic functionalities that exhibit wide applications in various fields, such as rechargeable batteries, supercapacitors, and catalysis. The internal strain due to intercalated and then released alkali\u2010ions and defects plays a critical role in tuning the energetically close correlated structures. However, such an effect is still elusive due to its fast dynamics at the atomic scale that requires both high temporal and spatial resolution. Herein, a chip\u2010based in situ scanning transmission electron microscope investigation is conducted, in which an abnormal tunnel to layered transition within a single MnO 2 nanowire is observed. The internal strain initiates a Jahn\u2013Teller active Mn 3+ transition to facilitate the Mn migration, which significantly reduces the Mn migration barrier and kinetically favors this abnormal transition. This work provides an atomistic insight into a strain effect in tuning the multi\u2010phase and valence transitions in the functional metal oxides, e.g., the phase transition in MnO 2 during K + \u2010ion extraction for K + \u2010ion batteries.",

      "abstract": "Laser power-dependent Raman spectroscopy is deployed to probe Fano interference in asymmetrically broadened Tg modes and the associated line shift in three technologically sound, meticulously characterized rare-earth sesquioxide systems. Group theoretical analysis is accompanied to introspect the Raman-active optic modes in cubic, monoclinic, and trigonal phases and identify the laser heating-induced local phase transitions. With increasing laser intensity, a regular redshift and larger negative asymmetry in the Raman peaks are detected, which is attributed to moderations in Fano scattering by enhanced electron\u2013phonon coupling amid the focussed photoexcited electron plasma and is illustrated using a Feynman diagram. A quantitative study is thereby performed to unveil the intrinsic nature of discrete-continuum Fano resonance in the nanoparticles of interest emphasizing the high sensitivity of Raman spectra to the excitation strength that perturbs the generic vibrational features at the Brillouin zone center by influencing the interference conditions, force constant, and length of the associated bonds compelled by tensile stress. A rising trend of the charge\u2013phonon coupling constant (\u03bb) with laser power validates a stronger particle\u2013quasiparticle coupling, whereas a shorter anharmonic phonon lifetime (\u03c4anh) indicates faster interactions. Using Allen's formalism, the charge density of states [N(\u03b5F)] at the Fermi level per spin and molecule is calculated, which pertains to a negative regression dependence in the \u03bbN(\u03b5F)\u2212\u03c4anh dynamics.",

      "abstract": "Abstract A hallmark feature of non-Hermitian (NH) systems is the non-Hermitian skin effect (NHSE), in which the eigenenergy spectra of the system under open boundary conditions (OBC) and periodic boundary conditions (PBC) differ markedly from each other. In particular, the critical NHSE occurs in systems consisting of multiple non-Hermitian chains coupled in parallel where even an infinitesimally small inter-chain coupling can cause the thermodynamic-limit eigenenergy spectrum of the system to deviate significantly from the OBC spectra of the individual component chains. We overturn the conventional wisdom that multiple chains are required for such critical transitions by showing that such a critical effect can also be induced in a single finite-length non-Hermitian chain where its two ends are connected together by a weak terminal coupling to form a closed loop. An infinitesimally small terminal coupling can induce the thermodynamic-limit energy spectrum of the closed loop to switch from the OBC to the PBC spectrum of the chain. Similar to the critical NHSE, this switch occurs abruptly when the chain length exceeds a critical size limit. We explain analytically the underlying origin of the effect in a Hatano\u2013Nelson chain system, and demonstrate its generality in more complex one-dimensional non-Hermitian chains. Our findings illustrate the generality of critical size-dependent effects in finite NH systems that arise from the interplay between the interfacial boundary conditions and the influence of edge localization.",

First is the near-field coupling between the emitter and the plasmon mode which underpins energy exchange between the system components and gives rise to exciton-induced transparency minimum in scattering spectra prior to the transition to a strong coupling regime. The second mechanism is the Fano interference between the plasmon dipole and the plasmon-induced emitter\u2019s dipole as the system interacts with the radiation field.

It has been found that both the qualitative and quantitative topology of phase diagrams crucially rely on the ratio of lane-switching rates called coupling strength. The proposed model has various unique mixed phases, including a double shock resulting in bulk-induced phase transitions. The interplay between both-sided coupling, third lane, and Langmuir kinetics produces unusual features, including a back-and-forth phase transition, also called a reentrance transition, in two directions for relatively nominal values of coupling strength. The presence of reentrance transition and peculiar phase boundaries leads to a rare type of phase division in which one phase lies entirely within another region.

      "abstract": "Employing the spin-orbit coupling effect by introducing halogen substituents is an excellent strategy to tune the magnetic behavior of organic or metal-organic materials. Light is an alternative tool to modulate the magnetic behavior of a material through a photoinduced electron transfer process, without changing its chemical identity. In this work, three halogen containing 1,4-bis(4,5-diphenyl-1<i>H</i>-imidazol-2-yl)benzene (F-BDPI, Cl-BDPI and Br-BDPI) systems have been chosen to exploit the role of halogen substituents on solid-state photoinduced phenomena. Through a comprehensive analysis involving various characterization techniques, including UV/vis diffuse reflectance, solid-state photoluminescence, and EPR measurements, it was found that the as-synthesized forms Cl-BDPI-IA and Br-BDPI-IA (IA denotes the hexahydrate form of Cl/Br-BDPI) exhibited fast photochromic response through the generation of photoinduced free radicals in the solid state. Moreover, the SQUID analysis revealed an antiferromagnetic to ferromagnetic transition in Cl-BDPI-IA through photoirradiation, which led to an increase in the magnetic moment value up to 38% at room temperature. This signifies the first occurrence of such a significant level of magnetization amplitude compared with previously reported metal-organic photomagnets. This investigation underscores the significance of halogen substitution in tailoring the magnetic properties of organic photomagnets, where strong halogen-\u03c0 and \u03c0-\u03c0 interactions facilitate the spin-orbit coupling effect in the solid state.",

      "abstract": "<title>Abstract</title> Based on a modified Morris\u2013Lecar neural model, the synchronization modes transitions between two coupled neurons or star-coupled neural network connected by weak electrical and chemical coupling are respectively investigated. For the two coupled neurons, by increasing the calcium conductivity, it is found that the period-2 synchronization of action potential of neurons is transformed to desynchronization first, and then to period-3 synchronization. By increasing the potassium conductivity, however, the synchronization mode transition is a reversal direction process as mentioned above. The bifurcation analysis of inter-spike interval shows that the synchronization modes transition is induced by the chaos. The stronger the coupling strength is, the smaller the period-2 synchronization region in the parameters plane is, while the larger the period-3 synchronization region will be. For the star-coupled neural network, in the presence of weak electrical coupling, it can exhibit the complete synchronization, desynchronization, and drum head mode states under different parameter values, respectively. In the presence of chemical synapse, however, the completely synchronized state can not be observed in the star-coupled neural network. Our results might provide novel insights into synchronization modes transition and related biological experiments.",

Hence, there is growing interest in finding \u2018positive tipping points\u2019 at which small interventions can trigger self-reinforcing feedbacks that accelerate systemic change. Examples have recently been seen in power generation and personal transport, but how can we identify positive tipping points that have yet to occur? We synthesise theory and examples to provide initial guidelines for creating enabling conditions, sensing when a system can be positively tipped, who can trigger it, and how they can trigger it. All of us can play a part in triggering positive tipping points. Technical summary Recent work on positive tipping points towards sustainability has focused on social-technological systems and the agency of policymakers to tip change, whilst earlier work identified social-ecological positive feedbacks triggered by diverse actors. We bring these together to consider positive tipping points across social-technological-ecological systems and the potential for multiple actors and interventions to trigger them. Established theory and examples provide several generic mechanisms for triggering tipping points. From these we identify specific enabling conditions, reinforcing feedbacks, actors and interventions that can contribute to triggering positive tipping points in the adoption of sustainable behaviours and technologies. Actions that can create enabling conditions for positive tipping include targeting smaller populations, altering social network structure, providing relevant information, reducing price, improving performance, desirability and accessibility, and coordinating complementary technologies. Actions that can trigger positive tipping include social, technological and ecological innovations, policy interventions, public investment, private investment, broadcasting public information, and behavioural nudges. Positive tipping points can help counter widespread feelings of disempowerment in the face of global challenges and help unlock \u2018paralysis by complexity\u2019. A key research agenda is to consider how different agents and interventions can most effectively work together to create system-wide positive tipping points whilst ensuring a just transformation.

      "abstract": "Abstract The Earth system and the human system are intrinsically linked. Anthropogenic greenhouse gas emissions have led to the climate crisis, which is causing unprecedented extreme events and could trigger Earth system tipping elements. Physical and social forces can lead to tipping points and cascading effects via feedbacks and telecoupling, but the current generation of climate-economy models do not generally take account of these interactions and feedbacks. Here, we show the importance of the interplay between human societies and Earth systems in creating tipping points and cascading effects and the way they in turn affect sustainability and security. The lack of modeling of these links can lead to an underestimation of climate and societal risks as well as how societal tipping points can be harnessed to moderate physical impacts. This calls for the systematic development of models for a better integration and understanding of Earth and human systems at different spatial and temporal scales, specifically those that enable decision-making to reduce the likelihood of crossing local or global tipping points.",

      "abstract": "Abstract As the climate evolves over the next century, the interaction of accelerating sea level rise (SLR) and storms, combined with confining development and infrastructure, will place greater stresses on physical, ecological, and human systems along the ocean-land margin. Many of these valued coastal systems could reach \u201ctipping points,\u201d at which hazard exposure substantially increases and threatens the present-day form, function, and viability of communities, infrastructure, and ecosystems. Determining the timing and nature of these tipping points is essential for effective climate adaptation planning. Here we present a multidisciplinary case study from Santa Barbara, California (USA), to identify potential climate change-related tipping points for various coastal systems. This study integrates numerical and statistical models of the climate, ocean water levels, beach and cliff evolution, and two soft sediment ecosystems, sandy beaches and tidal wetlands. We find that tipping points for beaches and wetlands could be reached with just 0.25 m or less of SLR (~ 2050), with &gt; 50% subsequent habitat loss that would degrade overall biodiversity and ecosystem function. In contrast, the largest projected changes in socioeconomic exposure to flooding for five communities in this region are not anticipated until SLR exceeds 0.75 m for daily flooding and 1.5 m for storm-driven flooding (~ 2100 or later). These changes are less acute relative to community totals and do not qualify as tipping points given the adaptive capacity of communities. Nonetheless, the natural and human built systems are interconnected such that the loss of natural system function could negatively impact the quality of life of residents and disrupt the local economy, resulting in indirect socioeconomic impacts long before built infrastructure is directly impacted by flooding.",

      "abstract": "Abstract. Mass loss from the Antarctic Ice Sheet is the main source of uncertainty in projections of future sea-level rise, with important implications for coastal regions worldwide. Central to ongoing and future changes is the marine ice sheet instability: once a critical threshold, or tipping point, is crossed, ice internal dynamics can drive a self-sustaining retreat committing a glacier to irreversible, rapid and substantial ice loss. This process might have already been triggered in the Amundsen Sea region, where Pine Island and Thwaites glaciers dominate the current mass loss from Antarctica, but modelling and observational techniques have not been able to establish this rigorously, leading to divergent views on the future mass loss of the West Antarctic Ice Sheet. Here, we aim at closing this knowledge gap by conducting a systematic investigation of the stability regime of Pine Island Glacier. To this end we show that early warning indicators in model simulations robustly detect the onset of the marine ice sheet instability. We are thereby able to identify three distinct tipping points in response to increases in ocean-induced melt. The third and final event, triggered by an ocean warming of approximately 1.2 \u2218C from the steady-state model configuration, leads to a retreat of the entire glacier that could initiate a collapse of the West Antarctic Ice Sheet.",

However, much less is known about the most efficient ways to reach such transitions or how self-reinforcing systemic transformations might be instigated through policy. We employ an agent-based model to study the emergence of social tipping points through various feedback loops that have been previously identified to constitute an ecological approach to human behavior. Our model suggests that even a linear introduction of pro-environmental affordances (action opportunities) to a social system can have non-linear positive effects on the emergence of collective pro-environmental behavior patterns. We validate the model against data on the evolution of cycling and driving behaviors in Copenhagen.

The literature on tipping points has grown rapidly, but almost exclusively based on aquatic and aboveground systems. So far little effort has been made to make links to soil systems, where change is not as drastically apparent, timescales may differ and recovery may be slower. Predicting belowground ecosystem state transitions and recovery, and their impacts on aboveground systems, remains a major scientific, practical and policy challenge. Recently observed major changes in aboveground tree condition across European forests are probably causally linked to ectomycorrhizal (EM) fungal changes belowground. Based on recent breakthroughs in data collection and analysis, we apply tipping point theory to forests, including their belowground component, focusing on EM fungi; link environmental thresholds for EM fungi with nutrient imbalances in forest trees; explore the role of phenotypic plasticity in EM fungal adaptation to, and recovery from, environmental change; and propose major positive feedback mechanisms to understand, address and predict forest ecosystem tipping points.",

      "abstract": "Theory and observation tell us that many complex systems exhibit tipping points\u2014thresholds involving an abrupt and irreversible transition to a contrasting dynamical regime. Such events are commonly referred to as critical transitions. Current research seeks to develop early warning signals (EWS) of critical transitions that could help prevent undesirable events such as ecosystem collapse. However, conventional EWS do not indicate the type of transition, since they are based on the generic phenomena of critical slowing down. For instance, they may fail to distinguish the onset of oscillations (e.g. Hopf bifurcation) from a transition to a distant attractor (e.g. Fold bifurcation). Moreover, conventional EWS are less reliable in systems with density-dependent noise. Other EWS based on the power spectrum (spectral EWS) have been proposed, but they rely upon spectral reddening, which does not occur prior to critical transitions with an oscillatory component. Here, we use Ornstein\u2013Uhlenbeck theory to derive analytic approximations for EWS prior to each type of local bifurcation, thereby creating new spectral EWS that provide greater sensitivity to transition proximity; higher robustness to density-dependent noise and bifurcation type; and clues to the type of approaching transition. We demonstrate the advantage of applying these spectral EWS in concert with conventional EWS using a population model, and show that they provide a characteristic signal prior to two different Hopf bifurcations in data from a predator\u2013prey chemostat experiment. The ability to better infer and differentiate the nature of upcoming transitions in complex systems will help humanity manage critical transitions in the Anthropocene Era.",

Warming-induced tipping points in Arctic and alpine treeless ecosystems are, however, little understood. Here, we compare two long-term recruitment datasets of 2,770 shrubs from coastal East Greenland and from the Tibetan Plateau against atmospheric circulation patterns between 1871 and 2010 Common Era. Increasing rates of shrub recruitment since 1871 reached critical tipping points in the 1930s and 1960s on the Tibetan Plateau and in East Greenland, respectively. A recent decline in shrub recruitment in both datasets was likely related to warmer and drier climates, with a stronger May to July El Ni\u00f1o Southern Oscillation over the Tibetan Plateau and a stronger June to July Atlantic Multidecadal Oscillation over Greenland. Exceeding the thermal optimum of shrub recruitment, the recent warming trend may cause soil moisture deficit. Our findings suggest that changes in atmospheric circulation explain regional climate dynamics and associated response patterns in Arctic and alpine shrub communities, knowledge that should be considered to protect vulnerable high-elevation and high-latitude ecosystems from the cascading effects of anthropogenic warming.",

      "abstract": "Multiple-input multiple-output orthogonal frequency division multiplexing with index modulation (MIMO-OFDM-IM) has recently received increased attention, due to the potential advantage to balance the trade-off between spectral efficiency (SE) and energy efficiency (EE). In this paper, we investigate the application of MIMO-OFDM-IM to millimeter wave (mmWave) communication systems, where a hybrid analogy-digital (HAD) beamforming architecture is employed. Taking advantage of the Pareto-optimal beam design, we propose a feasible solution to approximately achieve a globally Pareto-optimal trade-off between SE and EE, and the collision constraints of the multi-objective optimization problem (MOP) can be solved efficiently. Correspondingly, the MOP of SE-EE trade-off can be converted into a feasible solution for energy-efficient resource usage, by finding the Pareto-optimal set (POS) towards the Pareto front. This combinatorial-oriented resource allocation approach on the SE-EE relation considers the optimal beam design and power control strategies for downlink multi-user mmWave transmission. To ease the system performance evaluation, we adopt the Poisson point process (PPP) to model the mobile data traffic, and the evolutionary algorithm is applied to speed up the search efficiency of the Pareto front. Compared with benchmarks, the experimental results collected from extensive simulations demonstrate that the proposed optimization approach is vastly superior to existing algorithms.",

While ecologists have long studied food webs of feeding interactions, recent studies increasingly focus on mutualistic networks including plants that exchange food for reproductive services provided by animals such as pollinators. Here, we synthesize both types of consumer-resource interactions to better understand the controversial effects of mutualism on ecosystems at the species, guild, and whole-community levels. We find that consumer-resource mechanisms underlying plant-pollinator mutualisms can increase persistence, productivity, abundance, and temporal stability of both mutualists and non-mutualists in food webs. These effects strongly increase with floral reward productivity and are qualitatively robust to variation in the prevalence of mutualism and pollinators feeding upon resources in addition to rewards. This work advances the ability of mechanistic network theory to synthesize different types of interactions and illustrates how mutualism can enhance the diversity, stability, and function of complex ecosystems.",

In particular, recent theory clarified that within\u2010species population stability and among\u2010species asynchronous population dynamics combine to determine ecosystem temporal stability, but their relative importance in modulating diversity\u2010ecosystem temporal stability relationships in different ecosystems remains unclear. We addressed this issue with a meta\u2010analysis of empirical studies of ecosystem and population temporal stability in relation to species diversity across a range of taxa and ecosystems. We show that ecosystem temporal stability tended to increase with species diversity, regardless of study systems. Increasing diversity promoted asynchrony, which, in turn, contributed to increased ecosystem stability. The positive diversity\u2013ecosystem stability relationship persisted even after accounting for the influences of environmental covariates (e.g., precipitation and nutrient input). By contrast, species diversity tended to reduce population temporal stability in terrestrial systems but increase population temporal stability in aquatic systems, suggesting that asynchronous dynamics among species are essential for stabilizing diverse terrestrial ecosystems. We conclude that there is compelling empirical evidence for a general positive relationship between species diversity and ecosystem\u2010level temporal stability, but the contrasting diversity\u2013population temporal stability relationships between terrestrial and aquatic systems call for more investigations into their underlying mechanisms.",

      "abstract": "In 1972, Robert May showed that diversity is detrimental to an ecosystem since, as the number of species increases, the ecosystem is less stable. This is the so-called diversity-stability paradox, which has been derived by considering a mathematical model with linear interactions between the species. Despite being in contradiction with empirical evidence, the diversity-stability paradox has survived the test of time for over 40+ years. In this paper we first show that this paradox is a conclusion driven solely by the linearity of the model employed in its derivation which allows for the neglection of the fixed point solution in the stability analysis. The linear model leads to an ill-posed solution and along with it, its paradoxical stability predictions. We then consider a model ecosystem with nonlinear interactions between species, which leads to a stable ecosystem when the number of species is increased. The saturating non linear term in the species interaction is analogous to a Hill function appearing in systems like gene regulation, neurons, diffusion of information and ecosystems The exact fixed point solution of this model is based on k-core percolation and shows that the paradox disappears. This theoretical result, which is exact and non-perturbative, shows that diversity is beneficial to the ecosystem in agreement with analyzed experimental evidence.",

Here, we developed novel experiments of 600 microcosms with microplastic diversity ranging from 1 to 6 types and examined ecological networks for microbial communities in lake sediments after 2 months of incubation at 15 and 20 \u00b0C. We found that microplastic diversity generally enhanced the complexity of microbial networks at both temperatures, such as increasing network connectance and reducing average path length. This phenomenon was further confirmed by strengthened species interactions toward high microplastic diversity except for the negative interactions at 15 \u00b0C. Interestingly, increasing temperatures further exaggerated the effects of microplastic diversity on network structures, resulting in higher network connectivity and species interactions. Consistently, using species extinction simulations, we found that higher microplastic diversity and temperature led to more robust networks, and their effects were additionally and positively mediated by the presence of biodegradable microplastics.

      "abstract": "Saline lakes, characterized by high salinity and limited nutrient availability, provide an ideal environment for studying extreme halophiles and their biogeochemical processes. The present study examined prokaryotic microbial communities and their ecological functions in lentic sediments (with the salinity gradient and time series) using 16S rRNA amplicon sequencing and a metagenomic approach. Our findings revealed a negative correlation between microbial diversity and salinity. The notable predominance of Archaea in high-salinity lakes signified a considerable alteration in the composition of the microbial community. The results indicate that elevated salinity promotes homogeneous selection pressures, causing substantial alterations in microbial diversity and community structure, and simultaneously hindering interactions among microorganisms. This results in a notable decrease in the complexity of microbial ecological networks, ultimately influencing the overall ecological functional responses of microbial communities such as carbon fixation, sulfur, and nitrogen metabolism. Overall, our findings reveal salinity drives a notable predominance of Archaea, selects for species adapted to extreme conditions, and decreases microbial community complexity within saline lake ecosystems.",

      "abstract": "Abstract Foundation species structure communities, promote biodiversity, and stabilize ecosystem processes by creating locally stable environmental conditions. Despite their critical importance, the role of foundation species in stabilizing natural communities has seldom been quantified. In theory, the stability of a foundation species should promote community stability by enhancing species richness, altering the population fluctuations of individual species, or both. Here we tested the hypothesis that the stability of a marine foundation species, the giant kelp Macrocystis pyrifera , increased the stability of the aggregate biomass of a phylogenetically diverse assemblage of understory algae and sessile invertebrates that compete for space beneath the giant kelp canopy. To achieve this goal, we analyzed an 18\u2010yr time series of the biomass of giant kelp and its associated benthic community collected from 32 plots distributed among nine shallow reefs in the Santa Barbara Channel, USA. We showed that the stability of understory algae and sessile invertebrates was positively and indirectly related to the stability of giant kelp, which primarily resulted from giant kelp's direct positive association with species richness. The stability of all community types was positively related to species richness via increased species stability and species asynchrony. The stabilizing effects of richness were three to four times stronger when algae and invertebrates were considered separately rather than in combination. Our finding that diversity\u2013stability relationships were stronger in communities consisting of species with similar resource requirements suggests that competition for shared resources rather than differential responses to environmental conditions played a more important role in stabilizing the community. Increasing threats to structure\u2010forming foundation species worldwide necessitates a detailed understanding of how they influence their associated community. This study is among the first to show that dampened temporal fluctuations in the biomass of a foundation species is an important determinant of the stability of the complex communities it supports.",

      "abstract": "How ecosystems maintain stability is an active area of research. Inspired by applications of random matrix theory in nuclear physics, May showed decades ago that in an ecosystem model with many randomly interacting species, increasing species diversity decreases the stability of the ecosystem. There have since been many additions to May's efforts, one being an improved understanding the effect of mutualistic, competitive, or predator-prey-like correlations between pairs of species. Here we extend a random matrix technique developed in the context of spin-glass theory to study the effect of high-order correlations among species interactions. The resulting analytically solvable models include next-to-nearest-neighbor correlations in the species interaction network, such as the enemy of my enemy is my friend, as well as higher-order correlations. We find qualitative differences from May and others' models, including nonmonotonic diversity-stability relationships. Furthermore, inclusion of particular next-to-nearest-neighbor correlations in predator-prey as opposed to mutualist-competitive networks causes the former to transition to being more stable at higher species diversity. We discuss potential applicability of our results to microbiota engineering and to the ecology of interpredator interactions, such as cub predation between lions and hyenas as well as companionship between humans and dogs.",

      "abstract": "Abstract Aim Tree species diversity can increase the stability of ecosystem productivity by increasing mean productivity and/or reducing the standard deviation in productivity. However, stand structure, environmental and socio\u2010economic conditions influence plant diversity and might strongly influence the relationships between diversity and stability in natural forest communities. The relative importance of these factors for community stability remains poorly understood in complex (species\u2010rich) subtropical forests. Location Subtropical area of southern China. Time period 1999\u20132014. Major taxa studied Forest trees. Methods We conducted bivariate analyses to examine the mechanisms (overyielding and species asynchrony) underlying the effects of diversity on stability. Multiple regression models were then used to determine the relative importance of tree species diversity, stand structure, socio\u2010economic factors and environmental conditions on stability. Structural equation modelling was used to disentangle how these variables directly and/or indirectly affect forest stability. Results Tree species richness exerted a positive effect on stability through overyielding and species asynchrony, and this effect was stronger in mountainous forests than in hilly forests. Species richness positively affected the mean productivity, whereas species asynchrony negatively affected the variability in productivity, hence increasing forest stability. Structural diversity also had a positive effect, whereas population density had a negative effect on stability. Precipitation variability and slope mainly had indirect influences on stability through their effects on tree species richness. Main conclusions Overall, tree species diversity governed stability; however, stand structure, socio\u2010economic conditions and environmental conditions also played an important role in shaping stability in these forests. Our work highlights the importance of regulating stand structure and socio\u2010economic factors in forest management and biodiversity conservation, to maintain and enhance their stability to provide ecosystem services in the face of unprecedented anthropogenic activities and global climate change.",

      "abstract": "Abstract Trophic cascades \u2013 indirect effects of predators that propagate down through food webs \u2013 have been extensively documented in many ecosystem types. It has also been shown that predator diversity can mediate these trophic cascades and, separately, that herbivore biomass can influence the stability of primary producers. However, whether predator diversity can cause cascading effects on the stability of lower trophic levels has not yet been studied. We conducted a laboratory microcosm experiment and a field mesocosm experiment manipulating the presence and coexistence of two heteropteran predators and measuring their effects on zooplankton herbivores and phytoplankton basal resources. We predicted that if the predators partitioned their zooplankton prey, for example by size, then the co\u2010presence of the predators would reduce zooplankton prey mass and lead to (1) increased biomass of, and (2) decreased temporal variability of phytoplankton basal resources. We present evidence that the predators partitioned their zooplankton prey, leading to a synergistic suppression of zooplankton. In turn, this enhanced zooplankton suppression led to only a weak, non\u2010significant increase in the central tendency of phytoplankton biomass, but significantly reduced its variability. Our results demonstrate that predator diversity may indirectly stabilize basal resource biomass via a \u201cdiversity\u2010stability trophic cascade,\u201d seemingly dependent on predator complementarity, even when there is no significant classic trophic cascade altering the central tendency of biomass. Therefore predator diversity, especially if correlated with diversity of prey use, could play a role in regulating ecosystem stability. This link between predator diversity and producer stability has implications for conservation and for potential biological control methods to improve crop yield reliability.",

      "abstract": "Abstract Diversity and interspecific synchrony are among the main drivers behind the temporal stability of community abundance. Diversity can increase stability through the portfolio effect, while higher synchrony generally decreases stability. In turn, species interactions and similar responses to environmental variation are considered the main factors underlying the strength of interspecific synchrony, despite the challenges in determining their relative roles. The analysis of the relationship between interspecific synchrony and the trait (or phylogenetic) distance between species can increase the robustness of inferences about these factors. Here, we used pairwise interspecific and community\u2010wide analyses to investigate, respectively, the drivers of interspecific synchrony and the influence of trait and phylogenetic diversity on the stability of fish communities. For that, we used 18 years of fish abundance data from the Upper Paran\u00e1 River floodplain. At the interspecific level, we used quantile regressions to test within\u2010guild relationships between interspecific synchrony and trait and phylogenetic distance between species. At the community level, we tested the relationships between community\u2010wide synchrony, stability, and (trait and phylogenetic) diversity. We found that interspecific synchrony decreased with trait and phylogenetic distances. In the community\u2010level analysis, we found that more synchronous fish communities were less stable, but the relationship between diversity and stability was in general weak. At the interspecific level, our study highlights the role of similar responses to environmental variation in driving species' temporal dynamics. At the community level, the strength of the relationships between trait or phylogenetic diversity and community stability depended on the feeding guild. On the other hand, we found strong relationships between synchrony and stability. These results suggest that increased synchrony levels in response to regional environmental changes could decrease the stability of fish communities in this floodplain.",

      "abstract": "Abstract Several sub-Saharan African countries rely on irrigation for food production. This study examined the impact of environmental modifications resulting from irrigation on the ecology of aquatic stages of malaria vectors in a semi-arid region of western Kenya. Mosquito larvae were collected from irrigated and non-irrigated ecosystems during seasonal cross-sectional and monthly longitudinal studies to assess habitat availability, stability, and productivity of anophelines in temporary, semipermanent, and permanent habitats during the dry and wet seasons. The duration of habitat stability was also compared between selected habitats. Emergence traps were used to determine the daily production of female adult mosquitoes from different habitat types. Malaria vectors were morphologically identified and sibling species subjected to molecular analysis. Data was statistically compared between the two ecosystems. After aggregating the data, the overall malaria vector productivity for habitats in the two ecosystems was estimated. Immatures of the malaria vector (Anopheles arabiensis) Patton (Diptera: Culicidae) comprised 98.3% of the Anopheles in both the irrigated and non-irrigated habitats. The irrigated ecosystem had the most habitats, higher larval densities, and produced 85.8% of emerged adult females. These results showed that irrigation provided conditions that increased habitat availability, stability, and diversity, consequently increasing the An. arabiensis production and potential risk of malaria transmission throughout the year. The irrigated ecosystems increased the number of habitats suitable for Anopheles breeding by about 3-fold compared to non-irrigated ecosystems. These results suggest that water management in the irrigation systems of western Kenya would serve as an effective method for malaria vector control.",

We explain these findings by analytically constructing a general hydrodynamic model that results in a series of exponents depending on the number of conserved moments, yielding an accurate description of the scaling form of charge correlation functions.

      "abstract": "Abstract Anomalous-diffusion, the departure of the spreading dynamics of diffusing particles from the traditional law of Brownian-motion, is a signature feature of a large number of complex soft-matter and biological systems. Anomalous-diffusion emerges due to a variety of physical mechanisms, e.g., trapping interactions or the viscoelasticity of the environment. However, sometimes systems dynamics are erroneously claimed to be anomalous, despite the fact that the true motion is Brownian\u2014or vice versa. This ambiguity in establishing whether the dynamics as normal or anomalous can have far-reaching consequences, e.g., in predictions for reaction- or relaxation-laws. Demonstrating that a system exhibits normal- or anomalous-diffusion is highly desirable for a vast host of applications. Here, we present a criterion for anomalous-diffusion based on the method of power-spectral analysis of single trajectories. The robustness of this criterion is studied for trajectories of fractional-Brownian-motion, a ubiquitous stochastic process for the description of anomalous-diffusion, in the presence of two types of measurement errors. In particular, we find that our criterion is very robust for subdiffusion. Various tests on surrogate data in absence or presence of additional positional noise demonstrate the efficacy of this method in practical contexts. Finally, we provide a proof-of-concept based on diverse experiments exhibiting both normal and anomalous-diffusion.",

Fractional Brownian motion (FBM) with its long-range correlated yet Gaussian increments gives rise to anomalous and ergodic diffusion.

When studying time series recording the evolution of these systems, it is crucial to precisely measure the anomalous exponent and confidently identify the mechanisms responsible for anomalous diffusion. These tasks can be overwhelmingly difficult when only few short trajectories are available, a situation that is common in the study of non-equilibrium and living systems.

In particular, we demonstrate that the TUR bounds subdiffusion in a single file confined to a ring as well as a dragged Gaussian polymer chain even when detailed balance is satisfied. Conversely, the TUR bounds the onset of superdiffusion in the active comb model.

We here address the problem of resetting of an arbitrary stochastic anomalous-diffusion process (ADP) from the general mathematical points of view and assess ergodicity of such reset ADPs for an arbitrary resetting protocol. The process of stochastic resetting describes the events of the instantaneous restart of a particle\u2019s motion via randomly distributed returns to a preset initial position (or a set of those). The waiting times of such resetting events obey the Poissonian, Gamma, or more generic distributions with specified conditions regarding the existence of moments. Within these general approaches, we derive general analytical results and support them by computer simulations for the behavior of the reset mean-squared displacement (MSD), the new reset increment-MSD (iMSD), and the mean reset time-averaged MSD (TAMSD). For parental nonreset ADPs with the MSD(t)\u221d t\u03bc we find a generic behavior and a switch of the short-time growth of the reset iMSD and mean reset TAMSDs from \u221d _\u03bc for subdiffusive to \u221d _1 for superdiffusive reset ADPs. The critical condition for a reset ADP that recovers its ergodicity is found to be more general than that for the nonequilibrium stationary state, where obviously the iMSD and the mean TAMSD are equal. The consideration of the new statistical quantifier, the iMSD\u2014as compared to the standard MSD\u2014restores the ergodicity of an arbitrary reset ADP in all situations when the \u03bcth moment of the waiting-time distribution of resetting events is finite.

We address these questions in the current study. To describe different types of non-Brownian motion of particles-including power-law anomalous, ultraslow or logarithmic, as well as superfast or exponential diffusion-we here develop and analyze a generalized stochastic process of scaled-fractional Brownian motion (SFBM). The time- and space-SFBM processes are, respectively, constructed based on FBM running with nonlinear time and space clocks. The fundamental statistical characteristics such as non-Gaussianity of particle displacements, nonergodicity, as well as aging are quantified for time- and space-SFBM by selecting different clocks. The latter parametrize power-law anomalous, ultraslow, and superfast diffusion. The results of our computer simulations are fully consistent with the analytical predictions for several functional forms of clocks. We thoroughly examine the behaviors of the probability-density function, the mean-squared displacement, the time-averaged mean-squared displacement, as well as the aging factor.

      "abstract": "Heterogeneous dynamics commonly emerges in anomalous diffusion with intermittent transitions of diffusion states but proves challenging to identify using conventional statistical methods. To effectively capture these transient changes of diffusion states, we propose a deep learning model (U-AnDi) for the semantic segmentation of anomalous diffusion trajectories. This model is developed with the dilated causal convolution (DCC), gated activation unit (GAU), and U-Net architecture. The study addresses two key subtasks related to trajectory segmentation and changepoint detection, concentrating on variations in diffusion exponents and dynamic models. Additionally, extended analyses are conducted on the segmentation of single-model trajectories, multistate biological trajectories, and anomalous diffusion with added correlation functions. By rationally designing comparative models and evaluating the performance of U-AnDi against these models, we discover that U-AnDi consistently outperforms other models across all segmentation tasks, thereby affirming its superiority in the field. This performance edge also sheds light on the interpretability of U-AnDi's core components: DCC, GAU, and U-Net. The clarity with which these components contribute to U-AnDi's success underscores their congruence with the intrinsic physics underlying anomalous diffusion. Furthermore, our model is examined using real-world anomalous diffusion data: the diffusion of transmembrane proteins on cell membrane surfaces, and the segmentation results are highly consistent with experimental observations. Our findings could offer a heuristic deep learning solution for the detection of heterogeneous dynamics in single-molecule/particle tracking experiments, and have the potential to be generalized as a universal scheme for time-series segmentation.

      "abstract": "Abstract Why do parasites exhibit a wide dynamical range within their hosts? For instance, why does infecting dose either lead to infection or immune clearance? Why do some parasites exhibit boom\u2010bust, oscillatory dynamics? What maintains parasite diversity, that is coinfection v single infection due to exclusion or priority effects? For insights on parasite dose, dynamics and diversity governing within\u2010host infection, we turn to niche models. An omnivory food web model (IGP) blueprints one parasite competing with immune cells for host energy (PIE). Similarly, a competition model (keystone predation, KP) mirrors a new coinfection model (2PIE). We then drew analogies between models using feedback loops. The following three points arise: first, like in IGP, parasites oscillate when longer loops through parasites, immune cells and resource regulate parasite growth. Shorter, self\u2010limitation loops (involving resources and enemies) stabilise those oscillations. Second, IGP can produce priority effects that resemble immune clearance. But, despite comparable loop structure, PIE cannot due to constraints imposed by production of immune cells. Third, despite somewhat different loop structure, KP and 2PIE share apparent and resource competition mechanisms that produce coexistence (coinfection) or priority effects of prey or parasites. Together, this mechanistic niche framework for within\u2010host dynamics offers new perspective to improve individual health.",

      "abstract": "Peroxisome dynamics are crucial for intestinal stem cell (ISC) differentiation and gut regeneration. However, the precise mechanisms that govern peroxisome dynamics within ISCs during gut regeneration remain unknown. Using mouse colitis and Drosophila intestine models, we have identified a negative-feedback control mechanism involving the transcription factors peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors (PPARs) and SOX21. This feedback mechanism effectively regulates peroxisome abundance during gut regeneration. Following gut injury, the released free very long-chain fatty acids (VLCFAs) increase peroxisome abundance by stimulating PPARs-PEX11s signaling. PPARs act to stimulate peroxisome fission and inhibit pexophagy. SOX21, which acts downstream of peroxisomes during ISC differentiation, induces peroxisome elimination through pexophagy while repressing PPAR expression. Hence, PPARs and SOX21 constitute a finely tuned negative-feedback loop that regulates peroxisome dynamics. These findings shed light on the complex molecular mechanisms underlying peroxisome regulation in ISCs, contributing to our understanding of gut renewal and repair.",

Ensuring proper connection between the tyre and the road surface is essential for safety and good handling behaviour. Fundamental questions may arise about the details of the model, such as feedback delay, sampling effect, numerical differentiation in the control algorithm or the dynamical characteristics of the tyre model. In this article, a connected dynamical system is presented which contains a wheel model and a PID type traction controller. Steady state and dynamical brush type tyre models are presented and compared. Two different ways are described to model the feedback delay. The fully continuous time model contains constant time delay, while there is another case, where the sampling effect and the numerical differentiation methods of the control algorithm are presented. Finally, stability analysis of the delayed system is performed. The stability and performance characteristics and different bifurcations are presented using stability charts.

The construction of mathematical models using comprehensive information is one of the techniques of model construction. Such a comprehensive knowledge-based network tends to become a large-scale network. As a result, the variation of analyses is limited to a particular kind of analysis because of the size and complexity of the model. To analyze a large-scale regulatory network of neural differentiation, we propose a contractive method that preserves the dynamic behavior of a large network. The method consists of the following two steps: comprehensive network building and network reduction. The reduction phase can extract network loop structures from a large-scale regulatory network, and the subnetworks were combined to preserve the dynamics of the original large-scale network. We confirmed that the extracted loop combination reproduced the known dynamics of HES1 and ASCL1 before and after differentiation, including oscillation and equilibrium of their concentrations. The model also reproduced the effects of the overexpression and knockdown of the Id2 gene. Our model suggests that the characteristic change in HES1 and ASCL1 expression in the large-scale regulatory network is controlled by a combination of four feedback loops, including a large loop, which has not been focused on. The model extracted by our method has the potential to reveal the critical mechanisms of neural differentiation. The method is applicable to other biological events.",

Cross Impact Balance Analysis was used to develop consistent scenarios, which were then analysed to identify dominant feedback loops, both stabilizing and reinforcing.

These \"preparatory states\" largely determine the subsequent evolution of both neural activity and behavior, and their importance raises questions regarding how they are, or ought to be, set. Here, we formulate motor preparation as optimal anticipatory control of future movements and show that the solution requires a form of internal feedback control of cortical circuit dynamics. In contrast to a simple feedforward strategy, feedback control enables fast movement preparation by selectively controlling the cortical state in the small subspace that matters for the upcoming movement. Feedback but not feedforward control explains the orthogonality between preparatory and movement activity observed in reaching monkeys. We propose a circuit model in which optimal preparatory control is implemented as a thalamo-cortical loop gated by the basal ganglia.",

Ideally, one would like to derive conditions for stability or instability that, instead of microscopic details of the individual nodes or vertices, rather make the influence of the network coupling topology visible. The master stability function is an important such tool to achieve this goal. Here, we generalize the master stability approach to hypergraphs. A hypergraph coupling structure is important as it allows us to take into account arbitrary higher-order interactions between nodes. As, for instance, in the theory of coupled map lattices, we study Laplace-type interaction structures in detail. Since the spectral theory of Laplacians on hypergraphs is richer than on graphs, we see the possibility of different dynamical phenomena. More generally, our arguments provide a blueprint for how to generalize dynamical structures and results from graphs to hypergraphs.",

      "abstract": "Train-slab track spatial interactions generally deal with system vibrations in vertical, lateral and longitudinal directions. In the majority of conventional dynamics models, vertical-lateral coupling effects are of main concern, and great progress has also been achieved in the field of train longitudinal dynamics in recent years. However, for modelling strategies of track structures, longitudinal coupling effects are always neglected and lateral vibration of track slab is assumed as rigid behavior. To this end, the classical vehicle-track coupled dynamics theory is extended in this paper by thoroughly implementing the track flexibility and advanced coupling relations into a three-dimensional train-slab track system. Rail axial, torsional and bending vibrations, as well as in-plane and flexural vibrations of track slab based on Kirchhoff or Mindlin plate theory, are simultaneously taken into account. Eigenvalues and forced vibrations of the track slab for both in-plane and flexural vibrations are tackled by a set of powerful trigonometric series serving as the unified trial functions. Moreover, wheel-rail, rail-track slab and track slab-base interactions are partially re-deduced due to the participation of foregoing new degrees of freedom (DOFs). The reliability of proposed dynamics model has been verified by the previous literature, ANSYS software and co-simulation technique. Comparisons between the presented model (PM) and conventional model (CM) indicate that dynamic responses are sensitive to the longitudinal coupling effects and slab in-plane vibration which should be paid adequate attention for more accurate evaluations on train-slab track interactions.",

      "abstract": "The outbreak of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) threatens the health and safety of all humanity. This disease has a prominent feature: the presymptomatic and asymptomatic viral carriers can spread the disease. It is crucial to estimate the impact of this undetected transmission on epidemic outbreaks. Currently, disease-related information has been widely disseminated by the mass media. To investigate the impact of both individuals and mass media information dissemination on the epidemic spreading, we establish a new UAU-SEIR (Unaware-Aware-Unaware-Susceptible-Exposed-Infected-Recovered) model with mass media on two-layer multiplex networks. In the model, E-state individuals denote asymptomatic infections, and a single node connecting to all individuals denotes the mass media. In this work, we use the Microscopic Markovian Chain Approach (MMCA) to derive the epidemic threshold. Comparing the MMCA theoretical results with Monte Carlo (MC) simulations, we find that the MMCA has a good consistency with MC simulations. In addition, we also analyze the impact of model parameters on epidemic spreading and epidemic threshold. The results show that reducing the proportion of asymptomatic infections, accelerating the dissemination of information between individuals and the dissemination of information via the mass media can effectively inhibit the epidemic spreading and raise the epidemic threshold.",

      "abstract": "For railway locomotive, its motor bearing is one of the key components, which is likely to be damaged due to the intensified vibration conditions caused by the wheel-rail interaction and gear mesh. In this paper, a locomotive-track spatially coupled dynamics model considering the dynamic effect of the traction power transmission is established to investigate the dynamic responses of traction motor bearings. The detailed structure of the traction motor, complex internal interactions of the rolling bearing itself, time-varying gear mesh stiffness, and wheel-rail interaction are considered. The simulated results indicate that the gear mesh excitation and internal interactions of the motor bearings significantly affect the dynamic characteristics of the rotor. The motor bearing at the driving end surfers more dynamic loads, and the internal interactions between the components are more intensified than that of the bearing at the non-driving end. Moreover, the skidding phenomenon of the motor bearing at the driving end is alleviated by the greater radial load. Additionally, the wheel-rail interaction with track random irregularity will deteriorate the working conditions of the motor bearings. The modelling method and results can provide helpful theoretical guidance for the motor bearing design and structure optimization of the locomotive traction motor.",

      "abstract": "Abstract. The nature of compositional heterogeneity in Earth's lower mantle remains a long-standing puzzle that can inform about the long-term thermochemical evolution and dynamics of our planet. Here, we use global-scale 2D models of thermochemical mantle convection to investigate the coupled evolution and mixing of (intrinsically dense) recycled and (intrinsically strong) primordial heterogeneity in the mantle. We explore the effects of ancient compositional layering of the mantle, as motivated by magma ocean solidification studies, and of the physical parameters of primordial material. Depending on these physical parameters, our models predict various regimes of mantle evolution and heterogeneity preservation over 4.5 Gyr. Over a wide parameter range, primordial and recycled heterogeneity are predicted to co-exist with each other in the lower mantle of Earth-like planets. Primordial material usually survives as medium- to large-scale blobs (or streaks) in the mid-mantle, around 1000\u20132000 km depth, and this preservation is largely independent of the initial primordial-material volume. In turn, recycled oceanic crust (ROC) persists as large piles at the base of the mantle and as small streaks everywhere else. In models with an additional dense FeO-rich layer initially present at the base of the mantle, the ancient dense material partially survives at the top of ROC piles, causing the piles to be compositionally stratified. Moreover, the addition of such an ancient FeO-rich basal layer significantly aids the preservation of the viscous domains in the mid-mantle. Finally, we find that primordial blobs are commonly directly underlain by thick ROC piles and aid their longevity and stability. Based on our results, we propose an integrated style of mantle heterogeneity for the Earth involving the preservation of primordial domains along with recycled piles. This style has important implications for early Earth evolution and has the potential to reconcile geophysical and geochemical discrepancies on present-day lower-mantle heterogeneity.",

To evaluate the dynamic performance of the rail fastening system subject to dynamic interactions between vehicle and track, a refined vehicle-track coupled dynamics model involving an elaborated model of rail fastening clip (RFC) is developed in this work. Firstly, the RFC model is established based on the mode superposition method by which the difficulty in deducing dynamics equation due to the complex shape of RFC can be easily resolved. Then, the mode shape vectors and natural frequencies of RFC which required by the mode superposition method are obtained through a numerical modal analysis, and verified by a modal test. Finally, through the contact relationship between RFC and rail, the RFC model is implemented into the vehicle-track coupled dynamics model. The reliability of the proposed model is supported by a field test data, and the dynamic performances of rail fastening systems along the track subject to vehicle-track dynamic interactions can be efficiently and effectively evaluated. By applying the proposed model, the influences of rail corrugations, vehicle speeds, and rail pad stiffness on dynamic performances of the rail fastening system are evaluated in detail.",

      "title": "Development of vehicle-track coupled dynamics theory and engineering practice",
      "abstract": "<p indent=\"0mm\">Railway vehicles running on track structures constitute an interactive and inseparable large-scale dynamics system. For a long time, studies on railway vehicle dynamics and on track structure vibration were carried out separately due to the complexity of wheel-rail nonlinear systems and the classification of disciplines, which consequently results in the classical theory system of separate vehicle dynamics and track dynamics. However, the dramatic increase of operating speed and hauling mass of modern railway transportation intensifies dynamic interactions between vehicles and tracks, and such complicated vehicle-track interaction problems fail to be handled by the classical subsystem dynamics theory. Therefore, it is necessary to break through the subsystem research framework and comprehensively investigate the vehicle-track interaction mechanism, so as to achieve the optimal dynamic performance design of the whole system. For this purpose, the vehicle-track coupled dynamics theory system is developed on the basis of absorbing the theoretical achievements of vehicle dynamics and track dynamics, which treats the vehicle subsystem and the track subsystem as a large integrated system by establishing a wheel-rail spatial dynamic coupling model. The vehicle-track coupled dynamics problems can be divided into three aspects: The vertical, lateral and longitudinal coupled dynamics. Generally, the vehicle-track vertical coupled dynamics mainly studies the train-track vertical interaction problem. The vehicle-track lateral coupled dynamics focuses on the stability and safety of vehicle lateral movement on the elastic-damping track structure. In recent years, with the development of long marshalling heavy-haul trains, especially running in the complex environment of long ramps in mountainous areas, the longitudinal impulse of vehicles in a train and its influence on the track system are aggravated, bringing prominent safety problems of the train and track system, which is exactly the mission of longitudinal coupled dynamics research. In view of these three aspects, the vehicle-track coupled dynamics model has undergone the development process from simple to complex, including the unified vertical coupled model, the vertical-lateral spatial coupled model, and the vertical-lateral-longitudinal three-dimensional coupled model. In this paper, the theory system of vehicle-track coupled dynamics will be briefly introduced, including the academic rationale and its formation process. Most of the emphasis is laid on the construction of the unified model of vehicle-track vertical coupled dynamics (namely the fundamental model), and the vehicle-track spatial coupled dynamics model and its recent development. Based on the theory and its simulation platform, an optimal matching design principle of the vehicle and track dynamic performance is proposed, providing a scientific solution for high safety and high stability design of the modern rail transportation system. The vehicle-track coupled dynamics theory ends the long history of separate investigations on vehicle dynamics and track dynamics, and opens up a new research field of railway large-scale system dynamics. As a new theory system, it is recognized worldwide that the vehicle-track coupled dynamics has become the fundamental method for research on railway engineering dynamics after nearly <sc>30 years</sc> of development. This theory has been widely applied to railway engineering practice and has successfully solved a series of key dynamics problems in tremendous railway engineering projects. For this, some practical engineering projects are selected to illustrate the application of the theory, including the investigations on the selection of the plane and vertical profiles design scheme for a Chinese high-speed railway line, the key parameters design for a high-speed railway with a design speed of <sc>400 km/h,</sc> the design of rail asymmetrical grinding profiles for a heavy-haul railway curved line, the safety control of a long heavy-haul train under crush conditions, and the vibration reduction and optimization design of floating slab tracks for metro railways. It is demonstrated that the vehicle-track coupled dynamics theory and its applications strongly support the remarkable development of Chinese railways.",

In this study, based on the modal superposition method and finite element method, the flexibility of wheelsets and turnouts is considered respectively, and the vehicle-turnout coupled dynamic model is established. The swept-frequency analysis is adopted to capture the natural frequencies of wheelsets and turnouts. The dynamic interaction and modal resonance performance of the wheel-rail system are investigated when the vehicle passes through the turnout. Results indicate that during the wheel load transition in the crossing, the major frequency bands of the vertical wheel-rail impact force are related to natural frequencies of the crossing. Due to the wheelset resonant modes, the vertical impact force decreases by 12% in the through route and increases by 10% in the diverging route. The wheelset flexibility affects the wheel-rail creepage and decreases the longitudinal wheel-rail force. The wheel-rail impact force has nearly converged as the cut-off frequency of wheelsets reaches 500 Hz. The dominant frequencies of axle-box and rails' vibrations correspond to the modal resonance between the bending modes of wheelsets and the crossing in the vertical direction, as well as, the wheelset's umbrella mode and the crossing's pinned-pinned mode in the lateral direction.",

      "abstract": "Traction or braking operations are usually applied to the motor cars or locomotives for acceleration and deceleration, especially in perilous mountain high-speed railways that have complex and large gradient sections. Under such a circumstance, the wheel-rail longitudinal interactions may become more intense, which could induce longitudinal impact on the track structure. In this paper, some new concepts are introduced to account for this rarely concerned issue. Two typical interface interactions for a slab track system are fully considered, involving the longitudinal resistance between the rail and rail pad based on the Dahl friction model, and the longitudinal cohesive force between the prefabricated slab and CA (cement asphalt) mortar layer based on the bilinear cohesive zone model. By introducing system longitudinal vibrations and implementing the interface interactions into the classical vehicle-track system, a novel vehicle-slab track vertical-longitudinal coupled dynamics model is established, and investigated under the combined excitation of rail irregularities and polygonal wheel wear in traction conditions. Results indicate that the developed model is capable of capturing the longitudinal interactions between the track structures and enables considering initiation or evolution of the damage at the interface between the track slab and CA mortar subjected to complex train dynamic loads.",

The spring is tested experimentally, and a mathematical model is developed to show its force vs. displacement characteristics.

We focus on oleate-passivated PbSe nanoparticles dispersed across an ethylene glycol subphase as a model system and demonstrate how solvent parameters such as surface tension, nanoparticle solubility, aromaticity, and polarity influence the mesoscale morphology of the nanoparticle superlattice. We discovered that a nanoparticle precursor monolayer film spreads in front of the bulk solution and influences the fluid spreading across the subphase. Improved understanding of the impact of kinetic phenomena (i.e., solvent spreading and evaporation) on the superlattice morphology is important to describe the formation mechanism and ultimately enable the assembly of high-quality superlattices with long-range order.",

Our review highlights differences between network dynamics based on relational states (e.g., a friendship) and relational events (e.g., an email message), examines the drivers and effects of network dynamics, and in a methodological appendix, clarifies the assumptions, strengths, and weaknesses of different analytical approaches for studying network dynamics.

      "abstract": "Abstract In the majority of existing studies, streams are conceived as static objects that occupy predefined regions of the landscape. However, empirical observations suggest that stream networks are systematically and ubiquitously featured by significant expansion/retraction dynamics produced by hydrologic and climatic variability. This contribution presents novel empirical data about the active drainage network dynamics of a 5 km 2 headwater catchment in the Italian Alps. The stream network has been extensively monitored with a biweekly temporal resolution during a field campaign conducted from July to November 2018. Our results reveal that, in spite of the wet climate typical of the study area, more than 70% of the observed river network is temporary, with a significant presence of disconnected reaches during wet periods. Available observations have been used to develop a set of simple statistical models that were able to properly reconstruct the dynamics of the active stream length as a function of antecedent precipitation. The models suggest that rainfall timing and intensity represent major controls on the stream network length, while evapotranspiration has a minor effect on the observed intraseasonal changes of drainage density. Our results also indicate the presence of multiple network expansion and retraction cycles that simultaneously operate at different time scales, in response to distinct hydrological processes. Furthermore, we found that observed spatial patterns of network dynamics and unchanneled lengths are related to the underlying heterogeneity of geological attributes. The study offers novel insights on the physical mechanisms driving stream network dynamics in low\u2010order alpine catchments.",

      "abstract": "Abstract Evolutionary game theory and the adaptive dynamics approach have made invaluable contributions to understanding how gradual evolution leads to adaptation when individuals interact. Here, we review some of the basic tools that have come out of these contributions to model the evolution of quantitative traits in complex populations. We collect together mathematical expressions that describe directional and disruptive selection in class- and group-structured populations in terms of individual fitness, with the aims of bridging different models and interpreting selection. In particular, our review of disruptive selection suggests there are two main paths that can lead to diversity: (i) when individual fitness increases more than linearly with trait expression; (ii) when trait expression simultaneously increases the probability that an individual is in a certain context (e.g. a given age, sex, habitat, size or social environment) and fitness in that context. We provide various examples of these and more broadly argue that population structure lays the ground for the emergence of polymorphism with unique characteristics. Beyond this, we hope that the descriptions of selection we present here help see the tight links among fundamental branches of evolutionary biology, from life history to social evolution through evolutionary ecology, and thus favour further their integration.

      "abstract": "Abstract During range expansion, edge populations are expected to face increased genetic drift, which in turn can alter and potentially compromise adaptive dynamics, preventing the removal of deleterious mutations and slowing down adaptation. Here, we contrast populations of the European subspecies Arabidopsis lyrata ssp. petraea, which expanded its Northern range after the last glaciation. We document a sharp decline in effective population size in the range-edge population and observe that nonsynonymous variants segregate at higher frequencies. We detect a 4.9% excess of derived nonsynonymous variants per individual in the range-edge population, suggesting an increase of the genomic burden of deleterious mutations. Inference of the fitness effects of mutations and modeling of allele frequencies under the explicit demographic history of each population predicts a depletion of rare deleterious variants in the range-edge population, but an enrichment for fixed ones, consistent with the bottleneck effect. However, the demographic history of the range-edge population predicts a small net decrease in per-individual fitness. Consistent with this prediction, the range-edge population is not impaired in its growth and survival measured in a common garden experiment. We further observe that the allelic diversity at the self-incompatibility locus, which ensures strict outcrossing and evolves under negative frequency-dependent selection, has remained unchanged. Genomic footprints indicative of selective sweeps are broader in the Northern population but not less frequent. We conclude that the outcrossing species A. lyrata ssp. petraea shows a strong resilience to the effect of range expansion.",

      "abstract": "Climate change is an evolving business reality influencing the sustainability of ski tourism worldwide. A new integrated model of the co-evolution of supply (27 ski areas) and demand-side (skier behaviour) climate change adaptation in the ski tourism market of Ontario, Canada is presented. Ski area operations are modeled under a high-emission 2050s scenario, with skier responses to altered operations informed by a survey of 2429 skiers. These market adaptive dynamics reveal new insights into differential climate risk, capturing patterns not apparent when considering only operational conditions of ski resorts. A decoupling of ski season length and skier visitation was found at four ski areas, where, despite average season length losses, visitation increased as a result of reduced competition. Simulated skier visit losses were smaller than reductions in season length, contributing to an increase in crowding. Growing the market of skiers was also identified as a critical adaptation strategy that could offset skier visit losses from shortened seasons. Climate change challenges the future sustainability of ski areas in this market in several ways: profitability of ski areas with substantially shorter seasons, increased snowmaking costs, crowding impacts on visitor experience, and potential overtourism at the few most climate resilient destinations.",

      "abstract": "Learning from experience is a central mechanism underlying organizational capabilities. However, in examining how organizations learn from past experiences, much of the literature has focused on situations in which actors are facing a repeated event. We direct attention to a relatively underexamined question: when an organization experiences a largely idiosyncratic series of events, at what level of granularity should these events, and the associated actions and outcomes, be encoded? How does generalizing from experience impact the wisdom of future choices and what are the boundary conditions or factors that might mitigate the degree of desired generalization? To address these questions, we develop a computational model that incorporates how characteristics of opportunities (e.g., acquisition candidates, new investments, product development) might be encoded so that experiential learning is possible even when the organization\u2019s experience is a series of unique events. Our results highlight the power of learning through generalization in a world of novelty as well as the features of the problem environment that reduce this \u201cpower.\u201d Supplemental Material: The online appendix is available at https://doi.org/10.1287/orsc.2022.1609 .",

Identity narratives created during a five-week school placement are examined. Results show how, in a mentoring relationship, an internal I-position referencing a particular teaching identity is constructed in relation to an external I-position representing the PT's mentor. They demonstrate how a shift between teaching identities (internal I-positions) can be understood as a response to a perspective \u2018voiced\u2019 by an external position.

      "abstract": "Hypoxia-inducible factor-1 (HIF-1) is the key regulator of cellular adaptive response to hypoxia. Accumulating evidence shows that HIF-1 induces some non-coding RNAs (ncRNAs) including lncRNAs and miRNAs to modulate its own activity, enclosing several feedback loops. How the two classes of ncRNAs are orchestrated in the HIF-1-dependent adaptive response to hypoxia is poorly understood. By selecting lincRNA-p21 and miR-155 as the representatives, we develop an integrated model of the HIF-1 network comprising interlinked positive and negative feedback loops to clarify the interplay between the two ncRNAs in the hypoxic response. By numerical simulations, we find that coordination of lincRNA-p21 and miR-155 shapes the adaptive dynamics of HIF-1\u03b1: lincRNA-p21 induction in the early phase stimulates the upregulation of HIF-1\u03b1 via stabilizing it, while miR-155 induction in the late phase promotes the recovery of HIF-1\u03b1 via enhancing the degradation of its mRNA. Moreover, HIF-1\u03b1-induced PHD2 plays an auxiliary role in the decline of HIF-1\u03b1. In addition, lincRNA-p21 and miR-155 modulate each other via regulating HIF-1\u03b1 activity. Together, lincRNA-p21 and miR-155 coordinate in modulating HIF-1\u03b1 dynamics, and our work may shed light on the role for ncRNAs in the cellular adaptation to hypoxia.",

The AVQDS quantum circuits that prepare the time-evolved state are much shallower than those obtained from first-order Trotterization and contain up to 2 orders of magnitude fewer cnot gate operations.

In addition to exhibiting synapse-like resistive switching memory at their cross-point junctions, their self-assembly confers a neural network-like topology to their electrical circuitry, something that is impossible to achieve through conventional top-down fabrication approaches. In addition to their low power requirements, cost effectiveness and efficient interconnects, neuromorphic NWNs are also fault-tolerant and self-healing. These highly attractive properties can be largely attributed to their complex network connectivity, which enables a rich repertoire of adaptive nonlinear dynamics, including edge-of-chaos criticality. Here, we show how the adaptive dynamics intrinsic to neuromorphic NWNs can be harnessed to achieve transfer learning. We demonstrate this through simulations of a reservoir computing implementation in which NWNs perform the well-known benchmarking task of Mackey-Glass (MG) signal forecasting. First we show how NWNs can predict MG signals with arbitrary degrees of unpredictability (i.e. chaos). We then show that NWNs pre-exposed to a MG signal perform better in forecasting than NWNs without prior experience of an MG signal. This type of transfer learning is enabled by the network's collective memory of previous states. Overall, their adaptive signal processing capabilities make neuromorphic NWNs promising candidates for emerging real-time applications in IoT devices in particular, at the far edge.",

The quadrotor UAV system is divided into two parts: the position subsystem and the attitude subsystem. A virtual position controller based on backstepping is designed to address the coupling constraints and generate two command signals for the attitude subsystem. By establishing the communication mechanism between the UAVs and the virtual leader, a distributed formation scheme, which uses the UAVs' local information and makes each UAV update its position and velocity according to the information of neighboring UAVs, is proposed to form the required formation flight. By designing a neural adaptive sliding mode controller (SMC) for multi-UAVs, the compound uncertainties (including nonlinearities, unmodeled dynamics, and external disturbances) are compensated for to guarantee good tracking performance. The Lyapunov theory is used to prove that the tracking error of each UAV converges to an adjustable neighborhood of zero.

      "abstract": "Human interactions can take the form of social dilemmas: collectively, people fare best if all cooperate but each individual is tempted to free ride. Social dilemmas can be resolved when individuals interact repeatedly. Repetition allows them to adopt reciprocal strategies which incentivize cooperation. The most basic model for direct reciprocity is the repeated donation game, a variant of the prisoner\u2019s dilemma. Two players interact over many rounds; in each round they decide whether to cooperate or to defect. Strategies take into account the history of the play. Memory-one strategies depend only on the previous round. Even though they are among the most elementary strategies of direct reciprocity, their evolutionary dynamics has been difficult to study analytically. As a result, much previous work has relied on simulations. Here, we derive and analyze their adaptive dynamics. We show that the four-dimensional space of memory-one strategies has an invariant three-dimensional subspace, generated by the memory-one counting strategies. Counting strategies record how many players cooperated in the previous round, without considering who cooperated. We give a partial characterization of adaptive dynamics for memory-one strategies and a full characterization for memory-one counting strategies.",

      "abstract": "Abstract. Diversity plays a key role in the adaptive capacity of marine ecosystems to environmental changes. However, modelling the adaptive dynamics of phytoplankton traits remains challenging due to the competitive exclusion of sub-optimal phenotypes and the complexity of evolutionary processes leading to optimal phenotypes. Trait diffusion (TD) is a recently developed approach to sustain diversity in plankton models by introducing mutations, therefore allowing the adaptive evolution of functional traits to occur at ecological timescales. In this study, we present a model called Simulating Plankton Evolution with Adaptive Dynamics (SPEAD) that resolves the eco-evolutionary processes of a multi-trait plankton community. The SPEAD model can be used to evaluate plankton adaptation to environmental changes at different timescales or address ecological issues affected by adaptive evolution. Phytoplankton phenotypes in SPEAD are characterized by two traits, the nitrogen half-saturation constant and optimal temperature, which can mutate at each generation using the TD mechanism. SPEAD does not resolve the different phenotypes as discrete entities, instead computing six aggregate properties: total phytoplankton biomass, the mean value of each trait, trait variances, and the inter-trait covariance of a single population in a continuous trait space. Therefore, SPEAD resolves the dynamics of the population's continuous trait distribution by solving its statistical moments, wherein the variances of trait values represent the diversity of ecotypes. The ecological model is coupled to a vertically resolved (1D) physical environment, and therefore the adaptive dynamics of the simulated phytoplankton population are driven by seasonal variations in vertical mixing, nutrient concentration, water temperature, and solar irradiance. The simulated bulk properties are validated by observations from Bermuda Atlantic Time-series Studies (BATS) in the Sargasso Sea. We find that moderate mutation rates sustain trait diversity at decadal timescales and soften the almost total inter-trait correlation induced by the environment alone, without reducing the annual primary production or promoting permanently maladapted phenotypes, as occur with high mutation rates. As a way to evaluate the performance of the continuous trait approximation, we also compare the solutions of SPEAD to the solutions of a classical discrete entities approach, with both approaches including TD as a mechanism to sustain trait variance. We only find minor discrepancies between the continuous model SPEAD and the discrete model, with the computational cost of SPEAD being lower by 2 orders of magnitude. Therefore, SPEAD should be an ideal eco-evolutionary plankton model to be coupled to a general circulation model (GCM) of the global ocean.",

We report on the results of numerical simulations showing that, in the case where the cell mobility is bounded, compactly supported travelling fronts emerge. More mobile phenotypic variants occupy the front edge, whereas more proliferative phenotypic variants are selected at the back of the front. In order to explain such numerical results, we carry out formal asymptotic analysis of the model equation using a Hamilton\u2013Jacobi approach. In summary, we show that the locally dominant phenotypic trait (i.e. the maximum point of the local cell population density function along the phenotypic dimension) satisfies a generalised Burgers\u2019 equation with source term, we construct travelling-front solutions of such transport equation and characterise the corresponding minimal speed. Moreover, we show that, when the cell mobility is unbounded, front edge acceleration and formation of stretching fronts may occur.

Such quantum-like interference patterns can be found in biological data, on all scales, from proteins to cognitive, ecological, and social systems. The adaptive dynamics approach covers both biological and physical phenomena, including the ones which are typically associated with quantum physics. We guess that the adaptive dynamics can be used for the clarification of quantum foundations, and the present paper is the first step in this direction. We suggest the use of an algorithm for the numerical simulation of the behavior of a billiard ball-like particle passing through two slits by explicitly considering the influence of the two-slit environment (experimental context). Our simulation successfully mimics the interference pattern obtained experimentally in quantum physics. The interference of photons or electrons by two slits is known as a typical quantum mechanical effect.

Humans in cities alter the eco-evolutionary play by simultaneously changing both the actors and the stage on which the eco-evolutionary play takes place. Urbanization modifies land surfaces, microclimates, habitat connectivity, ecological networks, food webs, species diversity, and species composition. These environmental changes can lead to changes in phenotypic, genetic, and cultural makeup of wild populations that have important consequences for ecosystem function and the essential services that nature provides to human society, such as nutrient cycling, pollination, seed dispersal, food production, and water and air purification. Understanding and monitoring urbanization-induced evolutionary changes is important to inform strategies to achieve sustainability. In the present article, we propose that understanding these dynamics requires rigorous characterization of urbanizing regions as rapidly evolving, tightly coupled human\u2013natural systems. We explore how the emergent properties of urbanization affect eco-evolutionary dynamics across space and time. We identify five key urban drivers of change\u2014habitat modification, connectivity, heterogeneity, novel disturbances, and biotic interactions\u2014and highlight the direct consequences of urbanization-driven eco-evolutionary change for nature's contributions to people. Then, we explore five emerging complexities\u2014landscape complexity, urban discontinuities, socio-ecological heterogeneity, cross-scale interactions, legacies and time lags\u2014that need to be tackled in future research.

      "abstract": "Abstract Understanding the movement of species\u2019 ranges is a classic ecological problem that takes on urgency in this era of global change. Historically treated as a purely ecological process, range expansion is now understood to involve eco\u2010evolutionary feedbacks due to spatial genetic structure that emerges as populations spread. We synthesize empirical and theoretical work on the eco\u2010evolutionary dynamics of range expansion, with emphasis on bridging directional, deterministic processes that favor evolved increases in dispersal and demographic traits with stochastic processes that lead to the random fixation of alleles and traits. We develop a framework for understanding the joint influence of these processes in changing the mean and variance of expansion speed and its underlying traits. Our synthesis of recent laboratory experiments supports the consistent role of evolution in accelerating expansion speed on average, and highlights unexpected diversity in how evolution can influence variability in speed: results not well predicted by current theory. We discuss and evaluate support for three classes of modifiers of eco\u2010evolutionary range dynamics (landscape context, trait genetics, and biotic interactions), identify emerging themes, and suggest new directions for future work in a field that stands to increase in relevance as populations move in response to global change.",

      "abstract": "Abstract Biological invasions, the establishment and spread of non\u2010native species in new regions, can have extensive economic and environmental consequences. Increased global connectivity accelerates introduction rates, while climate and land\u2010cover changes may decrease the barriers to invasive populations spread. A detailed knowledge of the invasion history, including assessing source populations, routes of spread, number of independent introductions, and the effects of genetic bottlenecks and admixture on the establishment success, adaptive potential, and further spread, is crucial from an applied perspective to mitigate socioeconomic impacts of invasive species, as well as for addressing fundamental questions on the evolutionary dynamics of the invasion process. Recent advances in genomics together with the development of geographic information systems provide unprecedented large genetic and environmental datasets at global and local scales to link population genomics, landscape ecology, and species distribution modeling into a common framework to study the invasion process. Although the factors underlying population invasiveness have been extensively reviewed, analytical methods currently available to optimally combine molecular and environmental data for inferring invasive population demographic parameters and predicting further spreading are still under development. In this review, we focus on the few recent insect invasion studies that combine different datasets and approaches to show how integrating genetic, observational, ecological, and environmental data pave the way to a more integrative biological invasion science. We provide guidelines to study the evolutionary dynamics of invasions at each step of the invasion process, and conclude on the benefits of including all types of information and up\u2010to\u2010date analytical tools from different research areas into a single framework.",

      "abstract": "Abstract Isoprenoids are among the largest and most chemically diverse classes of organic compounds in nature and are involved in the processes of photosynthesis, respiration, growth, development, and plant responses to stress. The basic building block units for isoprenoid synthesis\u2014isopentenyl diphosphate and its isomer dimethylallyl diphosphate\u2014are generated by the mevalonate (MVA) and methylerythritol phosphate (MEP) pathways. Here, we summarize recent advances on the roles of the MEP and MVA pathways in plant growth, development and stress responses, and attempt to define the underlying gene networks that orchestrate the MEP and MVA pathways in response to developmental or environmental cues. Through phylogenomic analysis, we also provide a new perspective on the evolution of the plant isoprenoid pathway. We conclude that the presence of the MVA pathway in plants may be associated with the transition from aquatic to subaerial and terrestrial environments, as lineages for its core components are absent in green algae. The emergence of the MVA pathway has acted as a key evolutionary event in plants that facilitated land colonization and subsequent embryo development, as well as adaptation to new and varied environments.",

      "abstract": "Understanding how genotypes map onto phenotypes, fitness, and eventually organisms is arguably the next major missing piece in a fully predictive theory of evolution. We refer to this generally as the problem of the genotype-phenotype map. Though we are still far from achieving a complete picture of these relationships, our current understanding of simpler questions, such as the structure induced in the space of genotypes by sequences mapped to molecular structures, has revealed important facts that deeply affect the dynamical description of evolutionary processes. Empirical evidence supporting the fundamental relevance of features such as phenotypic bias is mounting as well, while the synthesis of conceptual and experimental progress leads to questioning current assumptions on the nature of evolutionary dynamics-cancer progression models or synthetic biology approaches being notable examples. This work delves with a critical and constructive attitude into our current knowledge of how genotypes map onto molecular phenotypes and organismal functions, and discusses theoretical and empirical avenues to broaden and improve this comprehension. As a final goal, this community should aim at deriving an updated picture of evolutionary processes soundly relying on the structural properties of genotype spaces, as revealed by modern techniques of molecular and functional analysis.",

      "abstract": "Abstract Community protective immunity can affect RNA virus evolution by selecting for new antigenic variants on the scale of years, exemplified by the need of annual evaluation of influenza vaccines. The extent to which this process termed antigenic drift affects coronaviruses remains unknown. Alike the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2), seasonal human coronaviruses (HCoV) likely emerged from animal reservoirs as new human pathogens in the past. We therefore analyzed the long-term evolutionary dynamics of the ubiquitous HCoV-229E and HCoV-OC43 in comparison with human influenza A virus (IAV) subtype H3N2. We focus on viral glycoprotein genes that mediate viral entry into cells and are major targets of host neutralizing antibody responses. Maximum likelihood and Bayesian phylogenies of publicly available gene datasets representing about three decades of HCoV and IAV evolution showed that all viruses had similar ladder-like tree shapes compatible with antigenic drift, supported by different tree shape statistics. Evolutionary rates inferred in a Bayesian framework were 6.5 \u00d7 10\u22124 (95% highest posterior density (HPD), 5.4\u20137.5 \u00d7 10\u22124) substitutions per site per year (s/s/y) for HCoV-229E spike (S) genes and 5.7 \u00d7 10\u22124 (95% HPD, 5\u20136.5 \u00d7 10\u22124) s/s/y for HCoV-OC43 S genes, which were about fourfold lower than the 2.5 \u00d7 10\u22123 (95% HPD, 2.3\u20132.7 \u00d7 10\u22123) s/s/y rate for IAV hemagglutinin (HA) genes. Coronavirus S genes accumulated about threefold less (P &amp;lt; 0.001) non-synonymous mutations (dN) over time than IAV HA genes. In both IAV and HCoV, the average rate of dN within the receptor binding domains (RBD) was about fivefold higher (P &amp;lt; 0.0001) than in other glycoprotein gene regions. Similarly, most sites showing evidence for positive selection occurred within the RBD (HCoV-229E, 6/14 sites, P &amp;lt; 0.05; HCoV-OC43, 23/38 sites, P &amp;lt; 0.01; IAV, 13/15 sites, P = 0.08). In sum, the evolutionary dynamics of HCoV and IAV showed several similarities, yet amino acid changes potentially representing antigenic drift occurred on a lower scale in endemic HCoV compared to IAV. It seems likely that pandemic SARS-CoV-2 evolution will bear similarities with IAV evolution including accumulation of adaptive changes in the RBD, requiring vaccines to be updated regularly, whereas higher SARS-CoV-2 evolutionary stability resembling endemic HCoV can be expected in the post-pandemic stage.",

The presentation stresses analytical methods, concrete examples, and geometric intuition. The theory is developed systematically, starting with first-order differential equations and their bifurcations, followed by phase plane analysis, limit cycles and their bifurcations, and culminating with the Lorenz equations, chaos, iterated maps, period doubling, renormalization, fractals, and strange attractors. The prerequisites are comfort with multivariable calculus and linear algebra, as well as a first course in physics. Ideas from probability, complex analysis, and Fourier analysis are invoked, but they're either worked out from scratch or can be safely skipped (or accepted on faith). Changes to this edition include substantial exercises about conceptual models of climate change, an updated treatment of the SIR model of epidemics, and amendments (based on recent research) about the Selkov model of oscillatory glycolysis. Equations, diagrams, and every word has been reconsidered and often revised. There are also about 50 new references, many of them from the recent literature. The most notable change is a new chapter. Chapter 13 is about the Kuramoto model. The Kuramoto model is an icon of nonlinear dynamics. Introduced in 1975 by the Japanese physicist Yoshiki Kuramoto, his elegant model is one of the rare examples of a high-dimensional nonlinear system that can be solved by elementary means. Students and teachers have embraced the book in the past, its general approach and framework continue to be sound.",

The sparse identification of nonlinear dynamics (SINDy) algorithm is one approach to discover dynamical systems models from data. Although extensions have been developed to identify implicit dynamics, or dynamics described by rational functions, these extensions are extremely sensitive to noise. In this work, we develop SINDy-PI (parallel, implicit), a robust variant of the SINDy algorithm to identify implicit dynamics and rational nonlinearities. The SINDy-PI framework includes multiple optimization algorithms and a principled approach to model selection. We demonstrate the ability of this algorithm to learn implicit ordinary and partial differential equations and conservation laws from limited and noisy data. In particular, we show that the proposed approach is several orders of magnitude more noise robust than previous approaches, and may be used to identify a class of ODE and PDE dynamics that were previously unattainable with SINDy, including for the double pendulum dynamics and simplified model for the Belousov\u2013Zhabotinsky (BZ) reaction.",

      "abstract": "Abstract This paper presents a critical review of the nonlinear dynamics of hyperelastic structures. Hyperelastic structures often undergo large strains when subjected to external time-dependent forces. Hyperelasticity requires specific constitutive laws to describe the mechanical properties of different materials, which are characterised by a nonlinear relationship between stress and strain. Due to recent recognition of the high potential of hyperelastic structures in soft robots and other applications, and the capability of hyperelasticity to model soft biological tissues, the number of studies on hyperelastic structures and materials has grown significantly. Thus, a comprehensive explanation of hyperelastic constitutive laws is presented, and different techniques of continuum mechanics, which are suitable to model these materials, are discussed in this literature review. Furthermore, the sensitivity of each hyperelastic strain energy density function to coefficient variation is shown for some well-known hyperelastic models. Alongside this, the application of hyperelasticity to model the nonlinear dynamics of polymeric structures (e.g., beams, plates, shells, membranes and balloons) is discussed in detail with the assistance of previous studies in this field. The advantages and disadvantages of hyperelastic models are discussed in detail. This present review can stimulate the development of more accurate and reliable models.",

To overcome this problem, the physical parameters (i.e., pulse peak power and amplitudes of subpulses) are hereby embedded as additional input parameter controllers, which allow PINN to learn the physical constraints of different scenarios and perform good generalizability. Furthermore, PINN exhibits better performance than the data\u2010driven neural network using much less data, and its computational complexity (in terms of number of multiplications) is much lower than that of the split\u2010step Fourier method.

We first apply the SINDy with two regression methods, the thresholded least square algorithm and the adaptive least absolute shrinkage and selection operator which show reasonable ability with a wide range of sparsity constant in our preliminary tests, to a two-dimensional single cylinder wake at $Re_D=100$ , its transient process and a wake of two-parallel cylinders, as examples of high-dimensional fluid data. To handle these high-dimensional data with SINDy whose library matrix is suitable for low-dimensional variable combinations, a convolutional neural network-based autoencoder (CNN-AE) is utilized. The CNN-AE is employed to map a high-dimensional dynamics into a low-dimensional latent space. The SINDy then seeks a governing equation of the mapped low-dimensional latent vector. Temporal evolution of high-dimensional dynamics can be provided by combining the predicted latent vector by SINDy with the CNN decoder which can remap the low-dimensional latent vector to the original dimension. The SINDy can provide a stable solution as the governing equation of the latent dynamics and the CNN-SINDy-based modelling can reproduce high-dimensional flow fields successfully, although more terms are required to represent the transient flow and the two-parallel cylinder wake than the periodic shedding. A nine-equation turbulent shear flow model is finally considered to examine the applicability of SINDy to turbulence, although without using CNN-AE. The present results suggest that the proposed scheme with an appropriate parameter choice enables us to analyse high-dimensional nonlinear dynamics with interpretable low-dimensional manifolds.",

      "abstract": "Diabetic retinopathy (DR), which is seen in approximately one-third of diabetes patients worldwide, leads to irreversible vision loss and even blindness if not diagnosed and treated in time. It is vital to limit the progression of DR disease in order to prevent the loss of vision in diabetic patients. It is therefore essential that DR disease is diagnosed at an early phase. Thanks to retinal screening at least twice a year, DR disease can be diagnosed in its early phases. However, due to the variations and complexity of DR, it is really difficult to determine the phase of DR disease in current clinical diagnoses. This paper presents a robust artificial intelligence (AI)-based model that can overcome nonlinear dynamics with low computational complexity and high classification accuracy using fundus images to determine the phase of DR disease. The proposed model consists of four stages, excluding the preprocessing stage. In the preprocessing stage, fractal analysis is performed to reveal the presence of chaos in the dataset consisting of 12,500 color fundus images. In the first stage, two-dimensional stationary wavelet transform (2D-SWT) is applied to the dataset consisting of color fundus images in order to prevent information loss in the images and to reveal their characteristic features. In the second stage, 96 features are extracted by applying statistical- and entropy-based feature functions to approximate, horizontal, vertical, and diagonal matrices of 2D-SWT. In the third stage, the features that keep the classifier performance high are selected by a chaotic-based wrapper approach consisting of the k-nearest neighbor (kNN) and chaotic particle swarm optimization algorithms (CPSO) to cope with both chaoticity and computational complexity in the fundus images. At the last stage, an AI-based classification model is created with the recurrent neural network-long short-term memory (RNN-LSTM) architecture by selecting the lowest number of feature sets that can keep the classification performance high. The performance of the DR disease classification model was tested on 2500 color fundus image data, which included five classes: no DR, mild non-proliferative DR (NPDR), moderate NPDR, severe NPDR, and proliferative DR (PDR). The robustness of the DR disease classification model was confirmed by the 10-fold cross-validation. In addition, the classification performance of the proposed model is compared with the support vector machine (SVM), which is one of the machine learning techniques. The results obtained show that the proposed model can overcome nonlinear dynamics in color fundus images with low computational complexity and is very effective and successful in precisely diagnosing all phases of DR disease.",

The aortic segments are harvested from heart-beating donors screened for transplants. A mock circulatory loop is developed to reproduce physiological pulsatile pressure and flow. The results show cyclic axisymmetric diameter changes, which are satisfactorily compared to in-vivo measurements at a resting pulse rate of 60 bpm, with an additional bending vibration. An increase of the dynamic stiffness (i.e., storage modulus) with age is also observed. This increase is accompanied by a strong reduction with age of the cyclic diameter change during the heart pulsation at 60 bpm and by a significant reduction of the loss factor (i.e., damping). Large dissipation is observed at higher pulse rates due to the combined effects of fluid-structure interaction and viscoelasticity of the aortic wall.

      "abstract": "Particle- and agent-based systems are a ubiquitous modeling tool in many disciplines. We consider the fundamental problem of inferring the governing structure, i.e. interaction kernels, in a nonparametric fashion, from observations of agent-based dynamical systems. In particular, we are interested in collective dynamical systems exhibiting emergent behaviors with complicated interaction kernels, and for kernels which are parameterized by a single unknown parameter. This work extends the estimators introduced in Lu et al. (2019), which are based on suitably regularized least squares estimators, to these larger classes of systems. We provide extensive numerical evidence that the estimators provide faithful approximations to the interaction kernels, and provide accurate predictions for trajectories started at new initial conditions, both throughout the \"training\" time interval in which the observations were made, and often much beyond. We demonstrate these features on prototypical systems displaying collective behaviors, ranging from opinion dynamics, flocking dynamics, self-propelling particle dynamics, synchronized oscillator dynamics, to a gravitational system. Our experiments also suggest that our estimated systems can display the same emergent behaviors as the observed systems, including those that occur at larger timescales than those in the training data. Finally, in the case of families of systems governed by a parametric family of interaction kernels, we introduce novel estimators that estimate the parametric family of kernels, splitting it into a common interaction kernel and the action of parameters. We demonstrate this in the case of gravity, by learning both the \"common component\" 1/<i>r</i> <sup>2</sup> and the dependency on mass, without any a priori knowledge of either one, from observations of planetary motions in our solar system.",

For the continuous and discrete Kuramoto models with time delay on a general digraph, we provide two frameworks leading to the complete synchronization in terms of system parameters (maximal time delay and depth of spanning tree) and initial data. In related literature on Cucker--Smale flocking, the linear structure of the velocity coupling is crucially used in the matrix theory-based approach. However, the phase coupling function in the Kuramoto model is sinusoidal so that we cannot use the matrix theory directly as it is. To circumvent this difficulty, we lift the Kuramoto model to the second-order system by introducing an auxiliary frequency variable. In this second-order formulation, the Kuramoto model enjoys several similar mathematical structures as for the Cucker--Smale flocking model. Then we use a network structure containing a spanning tree and inductive argument on the propagation of frequency information along a spanning tree in the network to derive a complete synchronization estimate.",

      "abstract": "Active systems of self-propelled agents, e.g., birds, fish, and bacteria, can organize their collective motion into myriad autonomous behaviors. Ubiquitous in nature and across length scales, such phenomena are also amenable to artificial settings, e.g., where brainless self-propelled robots orchestrate their movements into spatial-temporal patterns via the application of external cues or when confined within flexible boundaries. Like their natural counterparts, these approaches typically require many units to initiate collective motion, so controlling the ensuing dynamics is challenging. Here, we demonstrate a simple mechanism that leverages nonlinear elasticity to tame near-diffusive motile particles in forming structures capable of directed motion and other emergent behaviors. Our elasto-active system comprises two centimeter-sized self-propelled microbots connected with elastic beams. These microbots exert forces that suffice to buckle the beam and set the structure in motion. We first rationalize the physics of the interaction between the beam and the microbots. Then we use reduced-order models to predict the interactions of our elasto-active structures with boundaries, e.g., walls and constrictions, and demonstrate how they can exhibit remarkable emergent behaviors such as maze navigation. These findings demonstrate that allowing and understanding changes in body morphology can enhance the capabilities of active matter systems and enable the design of robotic materials capable of space exploration, adaptation, and complex interactions with their surrounding environment.",

Synthetic biology enables programmed emergent behaviors in the biotic component of biohybrid machines, expounding vast potential benefits for building biohybrid swarms with sophisticated control schemes. The design of synthetic genetic circuits tailored toward specific performance characteristics is an iterative process that relies on experimental characterization of spatially homogeneous engineered cell suspensions. However, biohybrid systems often distribute heterogeneously in complex environments, which will alter circuit performance. Thus, there is a critically unmet need for simple predictive models that describe emergent behaviors of biohybrid systems to inform synthetic gene circuit design. Here, we report a data-driven statistical model for computationally efficient recapitulation of the motility dynamics of two types of Escherichia coli bacteria-based biohybrid swarms\u2014NanoBEADS and BacteriaBots. The statistical model was coupled with a computational model of cooperative gene expression, known as quorum sensing (QS). We determined differences in timescales for programmed emergent behavior in BacteriaBots and NanoBEADS swarms, using bacteria as a comparative baseline. We show that agent localization and genetic circuit sensitivity strongly influence the timeframe and the robustness of the emergent behavior in both systems. Finally, we use our model to design a QS-based decentralized control scheme wherein agents make independent decisions based on their interaction with other agents and the local environment. We show that synergistic integration of synthetic biology and predictive modeling is requisite for the efficient development of biohybrid systems with robust emergent behaviors.",

      "abstract": "From designing architected materials to connecting mechanical behavior across scales, computational modeling is a critical tool in solid mechanics. Recently, there has been a growing interest in using machine learning to reduce the computational cost of physics-based simulations. Notably, while machine learning approaches that rely on Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have shown success in learning mechanics, the performance of GNNs has yet to be investigated on a myriad of solid mechanics problems. In this work, we examine the ability of GNNs to predict a fundamental aspect of mechanically driven emergent behavior: the connection between a column's geometric structure and the direction that it buckles. To accomplish this, we introduce the Asymmetric Buckling Columns (ABC) dataset, a dataset comprised of three sub-datasets of asymmetric and heterogeneous column geometries where the goal is to classify the direction of symmetry breaking (left or right) under compression after the onset of instability. Because of complex local geometry, the \"image-like\" data representations required for implementing standard convolutional neural network based metamodels are not ideal, thus motivating the use of GNNs. In addition to investigating GNN model architecture, we study the effect of different input data representation approaches, data augmentation, and combining multiple models as an ensemble. While we were able to obtain good results, we also showed that predicting solid mechanics based emergent behavior is non-trivial. Because both our model implementation and dataset are distributed under open-source licenses, we hope that future researchers can build on our work to create enhanced mechanics-specific machine learning pipelines for capturing the behavior of complex geometric structures.",

While such scale-free patterns were identified experimentally in many different types of neural recordings, the biological principles behind their emergence remained unknown. Utilizing different network models and motivated by experimental observations, synaptic plasticity was proposed as a possible mechanism to self-organize brain dynamics toward a critical point. In this review, we discuss how various biologically plausible plasticity rules operating across multiple timescales are implemented in the models and how they alter the network\u2019s dynamical state through modification of number and strength of the connections between the neurons. Some of these rules help to stabilize criticality, some need additional mechanisms to prevent divergence from the critical state. We propose that rules that are capable of bringing the network to criticality can be classified by how long the near-critical dynamics persists after their disabling. Finally, we discuss the role of self-organization and criticality in computation. Overall, the concept of criticality helps to shed light on brain function and self-organization, yet the overall dynamics of living neural networks seem to harnesses not only criticality for computation, but also deviations thereof.",

A newly developed molecule-counting method determined that ~200 Arp2/3 complexes assemble at sites of clathrin-mediated endocytosis in human cells. Simulations predict that actin self-organizes into a radial branched array with growing ends oriented toward the base of the pit. Long actin filaments bend between attachment sites in the coat and the base of the pit. Elastic energy stored in bent filaments, whose presence was confirmed by cryo-electron tomography, contributes to endocytic internalization. Elevated membrane tension directs more growing filaments toward the base of the pit, increasing actin nucleation and bending for increased force production. Thus, spatially constrained actin filament assembly utilizes an adaptive mechanism enabling endocytosis under varying physical constraints.",

      "abstract": "Communication and oscillatory synchrony between distributed neural populations are believed to play a key role in multiple cognitive and neural functions. These interactions are mediated by long-range myelinated axonal fiber bundles, collectively termed as white matter. While traditionally considered to be static after development, white matter properties have been shown to change in an activity-dependent way through learning and behavior\u2014a phenomenon known as white matter plasticity. In the central nervous system, this plasticity stems from oligodendroglia, which form myelin sheaths to regulate the conduction of nerve impulses across the brain, hence critically impacting neural communication. We here shift the focus from neural to glial contribution to brain synchronization and examine the impact of adaptive, activity-dependent changes in conduction velocity on the large-scale phase synchronization of neural oscillators. Using a network model based on primate large-scale white matter neuroanatomy, our computational and mathematical results show that such plasticity endows white matter with self-organizing properties, where conduction delay statistics are autonomously adjusted to ensure efficient neural communication. Our analysis shows that this mechanism stabilizes oscillatory neural activity across a wide range of connectivity gain and frequency bands, making phase-locked states more resilient to damage as reflected by diffuse decreases in connectivity. Critically, our work suggests that adaptive myelination may be a mechanism that enables brain networks with a means of temporal self-organization, resilience, and homeostasis.",

      "abstract": "Bird flocks under predation demonstrate complex patterns of collective escape. These patterns may emerge by self-organization from local interactions among group-members. Computational models have been shown to be valuable for identifying what behavioral rules may govern such interactions among individuals during collective motion. However, our knowledge of such rules for collective escape is limited by the lack of quantitative data on bird flocks under predation in the field. In the present study, we analyze the first GPS trajectories of pigeons in airborne flocks attacked by a robotic falcon in order to build a species-specific model of collective escape. We use our model to examine a recently identified distance-dependent pattern of collective behavior: the closer the prey is to the predator, the higher the frequency with which flock members turn away from it. We first extract from the empirical data of pigeon flocks the characteristics of their shape and internal structure (bearing angle and distance to nearest neighbors). Combining these with information on their coordination from the literature, we build an agent-based model adjusted to pigeons\u2019 collective escape. We show that the pattern of turning away from the predator with increased frequency when the predator is closer arises without prey prioritizing escape when the predator is near. Instead, it emerges through self-organization from a behavioral rule to avoid the predator independently of their distance to it. During this self-organization process, we show how flock members increase their consensus over which direction to escape and turn collectively as the predator gets closer. Our results suggest that coordination among flock members, combined with simple escape rules, reduces the cognitive costs of tracking the predator while flocking. Such escape rules that are independent of the distance to the predator can now be investigated in other species. Our study showcases the important role of computational models in the interpretation of empirical findings of collective behavior.",

Past systems typically consist of identical agents; however, heterogeneous agents can exhibit asymmetric pairwise interactions which can be used to generate more diverse patterns of self-organization. Here, we study the effect of size heterogeneity in microrobot collectives composed of circular, magnetic microdisks on a fluid\u2013air interface. Each microrobot spins or oscillates about its center axis in response to an external oscillating magnetic field, in turn producing local magnetic, hydrodynamic, and capillary forces that enable diverse collective behaviors. We demonstrate through physical experiments and simulations that the heterogeneous collective can exploit the differences in microrobot size to enable programmable self-organization, density, morphology, and interaction with external passive objects. Specifically, we can control the level of self-organization by microrobot size, enable organized aggregation, dispersion, and locomotion, change the overall shape of the collective from circular to ellipse, and cage or expel objects. We characterize the fundamental self-organization behavior across a parameter space of magnetic field frequency, relative disk size, and relative populations; we replicate the behavior through a physical model and a swarming coupled oscillator model to show that the dominant effect stems from asymmetric interactions between the different-sized disks.

      "abstract": "Scale-free outbursts of activity are commonly observed in physical, geological, and biological systems. The idea of self-organized criticality (SOC), introduced back in 1987 by Bak, Tang, and Wiesenfeld suggests that, under certain circumstances, natural systems can seemingly self-tune to a critical state with its concomitant power-laws and scaling. Theoretical progress allowed for a rationalization of how SOC works by relating its critical properties to those of a standard non-equilibrium second-order phase transition that separates an active state in which dynamical activity reverberates indefinitely, from an absorbing or quiescent state where activity eventually ceases. The basic mechanism underlying SOC is the alternation of a slow driving process and fast dynamics with dissipation, which generates a feedback loop that tunes the system to the critical point of an absorbing-active continuous phase transition. Here, we briefly review these ideas as well as a recent closely-related concept: self-organized bistability (SOB). In SOB, the very same type of feedback operates in a system characterized by a discontinuous phase transition, which has no critical point but instead presents bistability between active and quiescent states. SOB also leads to scale-invariant avalanches of activity but, in this case, with a different type of scaling and coexisting with anomalously large outbursts. Moreover, SOB explains experiments with real sandpiles more closely than SOC. We review similarities and differences between SOC and SOB by presenting and analyzing them under a common theoretical framework, covering recent results as well as possible future developments. We also discuss other related concepts for \"imperfect\" self-organization such as \"self-organized quasi-criticality\" and \"self-organized collective oscillations,\" of relevance in e.g., neuroscience, with the aim of providing an overview of feedback mechanisms for self-organization to the edge of a phase transition.",

      "abstract": "Since the proposal of the differential adhesion hypothesis, scientists have been fascinated by how cell adhesion mediates cellular self-organization to form spatial patterns during development. The search for molecular tool kits with homophilic binding specificity resulted in a diverse repertoire of adhesion molecules. Recent understanding of the dominant role of cortical tension over adhesion binding redirects the focus of differential adhesion studies to the signaling function of adhesion proteins to regulate actomyosin contractility. The broader framework of differential interfacial tension encompasses both adhesion and nonadhesion molecules, sharing the common function of modulating interfacial tension during cell sorting to generate diverse tissue patterns. Robust adhesion-based patterning requires close coordination between morphogen signaling, cell fate decisions, and changes in adhesion. Current advances in bridging theoretical and experimental approaches present exciting opportunities to understand molecular, cellular, and tissue dynamics during adhesion-based tissue patterning across multiple time and length scales.",

      "abstract": "Self-organized spatial patterns are a common feature of complex systems, ranging from microbial communities to mussel beds and drylands. While the theoretical implications of these patterns for ecosystem-level processes, such as functioning and resilience, have been extensively studied, empirical evidence remains scarce. To address this gap, we analyzed global drylands along an aridity gradient using remote sensing, field data, and modeling. We found that the spatial structure of the vegetation strengthens as aridity increases, which is associated with the maintenance of a high level of soil multifunctionality, even as aridity levels rise up to a certain threshold. The combination of these results with those of two individual-based models indicate that self-organized vegetation patterns not only form in response to stressful environmental conditions but also provide drylands with the ability to adapt to changing conditions while maintaining their functioning, an adaptive capacity which is lost in degraded ecosystems. Self-organization thereby plays a vital role in enhancing the resilience of drylands. Overall, our findings contribute to a deeper understanding of the relationship between spatial vegetation patterns and dryland resilience. They also represent a significant step forward in the development of indicators for ecosystem resilience, which are critical tools for managing and preserving these valuable ecosystems in a warmer and more arid world.",

      "abstract": "We observe experimentally the spontaneous formation of star-shaped surface patterns in driven Bose-Einstein condensates. Two-dimensional star-shaped patterns with l-fold symmetry, ranging from quadrupole (l=2) to heptagon modes (l=7), are parametrically excited by modulating the scattering length near the Feshbach resonance. An effective Mathieu equation and Floquet analysis are utilized, relating the instability conditions to the dispersion of the surface modes in a trapped superfluid. Identifying the resonant frequencies of the patterns, we precisely measure the dispersion relation of the collective excitations. The oscillation amplitude of the surface excitations increases exponentially during the modulation. We find that only the l=6 mode is unstable due to its emergent coupling with the dipole motion of the cloud. Our experimental results are in excellent agreement with the mean-field framework. Our work opens a new pathway for generating higher-lying collective excitations with applications, such as the probing of exotic properties of quantum fluids and providing a generation mechanism of quantum turbulence.",

      "abstract": "Surface wrinkling in stiff-film/soft-substrate bilayers is a common phenomenon in biological systems and is increasingly being exploited in thin-film technology. While the onset of surface wrinkling in end-compressed bilayers is well understood, questions remain with regards to the evolution of the wrinkling pattern in the intermediate and deep post-wrinkling regimes, especially when the substrate is strongly pre-compressed. Here, we explore the bifurcation landscape of end-compressed bilayers with strongly pre-compressed substrates, using hyperelastic, plane strain finite-elements and generalized path-following algorithms. After bifurcating from a flat into a sinusoidally wrinkled state, bilayers undergo further n -tupling bifurcations into stable wrinkling patterns of longer wavelength whose periodicity <mml:math xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\"> <mml:mi>n</mml:mi> <mml:mo>=</mml:mo> <mml:mo fence=\"false\" stretchy=\"false\">{</mml:mo> <mml:mn>4</mml:mn> <mml:mo>,</mml:mo> <mml:mo>\u2026</mml:mo> <mml:mo>,</mml:mo> <mml:mn>8</mml:mn> <mml:mo fence=\"false\" stretchy=\"false\">}</mml:mo> </mml:math> is a function of overall bilayer length. These five n -tupling wrinkling patterns are shown to be independent localizations of the deformation mode and are accordingly identified as stable \u2018building blocks\u2019 that govern the intermediate post-wrinkling regime. Additional end-shortening into the deep post-wrinkling regime then leads to further period doubling and coalescence of the building blocks. Beyond a certain length threshold, a bilayer can form a combinatorial side-by-side arrangement of the five building blocks. In the limit of an infinitely long bilayer, this leads to the phenomenon known as spatial chaos with the emergence of an infinite set of possible wrinkling patterns. In reality, though, the precise side-by-side arrangement of the building blocks is governed by the initial conditions. We show that the morphological evolution of the wrinkling pattern can be programmed by a judicial placement of manufactured dents in the thin film, creating new manufacturing capabilities for textured bilayers.",

While simple mathematical models, such as reaction-diffusion systems, can explain the formation of such patterns, the complexity of the physical systems these models aim to describe necessitates the analysis of model robustness. Our work utilizes random matrix theory to provide arguably the first definition of robustness that is analytically tractable, providing an easy guide for identifying spatial interactions that robustly generate spatial patterns. We illustrate our theory on examples from mathematical biology, showing that diffusion alone cannot robustly generate spatial Turing patterns in large and unstructured systems, while advection, chemotaxis and non-local interactions can robustly promote pattern formation. Furthermore, we use our theory to prove that the spinodal decompositon of soft condensed matter is dynamically robust and predict the dynamics beyond regimes permitted by the standard Landau-Ginzburg theory. By classifying different spatial interactions based on the robustness of pattern formation, this work provides insights into which mechanisms are fundamental for pattern formation in large and unstructured physical systems.",

In molecular biophysics, this phenomenon often takes place under the influence of large fluctuations. It is then natural to inquire about the precision of such pattern. In particular, spontaneous pattern formation is a nonequilibrium phenomenon, and the relation between the precision of a pattern and the thermodynamic cost associated with it remains largely unexplored. Here, we analyze this relation with a paradigmatic stochastic reaction-diffusion model, i.e., the Brusselator in one spatial dimension. We find that the precision of the pattern is maximized for an intermediate thermodynamic cost, i.e., increasing the thermodynamic cost beyond this value makes the pattern less precise. Even though fluctuations get less pronounced with an increase in thermodynamic cost, we argue that larger fluctuations can also have a positive effect on the precision of the pattern.",

      "title": "Mechanosensory input during circuit formation shapes Drosophila motor behavior through Patterned Spontaneous Network Activity",
      "abstract": "Summary Neural activity sculpts circuit wiring in many animals. In vertebrates, patterned spontaneous network activity (PaSNA) generates sensory maps and establishes local circuits 1\u20133 . However, it remains unclear how PaSNA might shape neuronal circuits and behavior in invertebrates. Previous work in the developing Drosophila embryo discovered spontaneous muscle activity that did not require synaptic transmission, and hence was myogenic, preceding PaSNA 4\u20136 . These studies, however, monitored muscle movement, not neural activity, and were therefore unable to observe how myogenic activity might relate to subsequent neural network engagement. Here we use calcium imaging to directly record neural activity and characterize the emergence of PaSNA. We demonstrate that the spatiotemporal properties of PaSNA are highly stereotyped across embryos, arguing for genetic programming. Consistent with previous observations, we observe neural activity well before it becomes patterned, initially emerging during the myogenic stage. Remarkably, inhibition of mechanosensory input as well as inhibition of muscle contractions results in premature and excessive PaSNA, demonstrating that muscle movement serves as a brake on this process. Finally, using an optogenetic strategy to selectively disrupt mechanosensory inputs during PaSNA, followed by quantitative modeling of larval behavior, we demonstrate that mechanosensory modulation during development is required for proper larval foraging. This work thus provides a foundation for using the Drosophila embryo to study the role of PaSNA in circuit formation, provides mechanistic insight into how PaSNA is entrained by motor activity, and demonstrates that spontaneous network activity is essential for locomotor behavior. These studies argue that sensory feedback during the earliest stages of circuit formation can sculpt locomotor behaviors through innate motor learning. Highlights PaSNA in the Drosophila embryonic CNS is spatiotemporally stereotyped Mechanosensory neurons negatively modulate PaSNA Embryonic PaSNA is required for larval locomotor behavior",

The transition can be understood as a nonanalytic change in the amount of information extracted by the measurements about the initial state of the system, quantified by the Fisher information. To compute the von Neumann entanglement entropy $\\\\textit{S}$ and the Fisher information $\\\\mathcal{F}$, we apply a replica method based on a sequence of quantities $\\\\tilde{S}^{(n)}$ and $\\\\mathcal{F}^{(n)}$ that depend on the $\\\\textit{n}$th moments of density matrices and reduce to $\\\\textit{S}$ and $\\\\mathcal{F}$ in the limit $\\\\textit{n}$ \u2192 1. These quantities with $\\\\textit{n}$ \u2265 2 are mapped to free energies of a classical spin model with $\\\\textit{n}$! internal states in two dimensions with specific boundary conditions. In particular, $\\\\tilde{S}^{(n)}$ is the excess free energy of a domain wall terminating on the top boundary, and $\\\\mathcal{F}^{(n)}$ is related to the magnetization on the bottom boundary. Phase transitions occur as the spin models undergo ordering transitions in the bulk. Taking the limit of large local Hilbert space dimension $\\\\textit{q}$ followed by the replica limit $\\\\textit{n}$ \u2192 1, we obtain the critical measurement probability $p_c$ = 1/2 and identify the transition as a bond percolation in the 2D square lattice in this limit. Finally, we show there is no phase transition if the measurements are allowed in an arbitrary nonlocal basis, thereby highlighting the relation between the phase transition and information scrambling. We establish an explicit connection between the entanglement phase transition and the purification dynamics of a mixed state evolution and discuss implications of our results to experimental observations of the transition and simulability of quantum dynamics.",

We introduce a random unitary circuit model with intermittent projective measurements, in which the degree of information scrambling by the unitary and the rate of projective measurements are independently controlled. This model displays two stable phases, characterized by the volume-law and area-law scaling entanglement entropy in steady states. The transition between the two phases is understood from the point of view of quantum error correction: the chaotic unitary evolution protects quantum information from projective measurements that act as errors. A phase transition occurs when the rate of errors exceeds a threshold that depends on the degree of information scrambling. We confirm these results using numerical simulations and obtain the phase diagram of our model. Our work shows that information scrambling plays a crucial role in understanding the dynamics of entanglement in an open quantum system and relates the entanglement phase transition to changes in quantum channel capacity.",

      "abstract": "Unitary circuits subject to repeated projective measurements can undergo an entanglement phase transition (EPT) as a function of the measurement rate. This transition is generally understood in terms of a competition between the scrambling effects of unitary dynamics and the disentangling effects of measurements. We find that, surprisingly, EPTs are possible even in the absence of scrambling unitary dynamics, where they are best understood as arising from measurements alone. This finding motivates us to introduce measurement-only models, in which the \u201cscrambling\u201d and \u201cunscrambling\u201d effects driving the EPT are fundamentally intertwined and cannot be attributed to physically distinct processes. These models represent a novel form of an EPT, conceptually distinct from that in hybrid unitary-projective circuits. We explore the entanglement phase diagrams, critical points, and quantum code properties of some of these measurement-only models. We find that the principle driving the EPTs in these models is frustration, or mutual incompatibility, of the measurements. Surprisingly, an entangling (volume-law) phase is the generic outcome when measuring sufficiently long but still local (\u2273 3 -body) operators. We identify a class of exceptions to this behavior (\u201cbipartite ensembles\u201d) which cannot sustain an entangling phase but display dual area-law phases, possibly with different kinds of quantum order, separated by self-dual critical points. Finally, we introduce a measure of information spreading in dynamics with measurements and use it to demonstrate the emergence of a statistical light cone, despite the nonlocality inherent to quantum measurements.",

However, such an improvement in sensitivity is counterbalanced by the closing of the energy gap, which implies a critical slowing down and an inevitable growth of the protocol duration. Here, we design different metrological protocols that exploit the superradiant phase transition of the quantum Rabi model, a finite-component system composed of a single two-level atom interacting with a single bosonic mode. We show that, in spite of the critical slowing down, critical quantum optical probes can achieve a quantum-enhanced time scaling of the sensitivity in frequency-estimation protocols.",

Using large-scale quantum Monte Carlo simulations, we identify a continuous quantum phase transition between a phase with spontaneous fractal symmetry breaking and a paramagnetic phase. This phase transition is characterized by the emergence of a fractal scaling dimension $d=\\ln(3)/\\ln(2)$ at the quantum critical point, where the power-law exponent of the correlation function is related to the fractal dimension of the Sierpinski triangle.

The critical exponents \u03b2 and \u03b3 do not fall into any particular universality class upon proton irradiation. However, for pristine and irradiated samples, the critical exponents lie closer to mean field-like interactions; therefore, long-range interactions are presumed to be sustained in MST. The effective spatial dimensionality reveals that MST remains at d=3 under proton irradiation, whereas spin dimensionality transitions from an initial n=1 to n=2 and n=3 for 1 \u00d7 1015 and 5 \u00d7 1015 H+/cm2, indicating XY and Heisenberg interactions, respectively. The spin correlation function reveals an increase in magnetic correlations at 5 \u00d7 1015 H+/cm2. Maximum change in magnetic entropy at 3 T is the largest for 5 \u00d7 1015 H+/cm2 at 2.45 J/kg K, in comparison to 1.60 J/kg K for pristine MST. These results intriguingly align with previous findings on MST where magnetization increased by \u223c50% at 5 \u00d7 1015 H+/cm2, in comparison to its pristine counterpart [Martinez et al., Appl. Phys. Lett. 116, 172404 (2020)]. Magnetic entropy derived from heat capacity analysis shows no large deviations across the proton irradiated samples suggesting that the antiferromagnetic (AFM) coupling between the Mn sites is stable even after proton irradiation. This implies that magnetization is enhanced through a strengthening of the super-exchange interaction between Mn atoms mediated through Te rather than a weakening of the AFM component.",

      "abstract": "Abstract Mountain forests are at particular risk of climate change impacts due to their temperature limitation and high exposure to warming. At the same time, their complex topography may help to buffer the effects of climate change and create climate refugia. Whether climate change can lead to critical transitions of mountain forest ecosystems and whether such transitions are reversible remain incompletely understood. We investigated the resilience of forest composition and size structure to climate change, focusing on a mountain forest landscape in the Eastern Alps. Using the individual\u2010based forest landscape model iLand, we simulated ecosystem responses to a wide range of climatic changes (up to a 6\u00b0C increase in mean annual temperature and a 30% reduction in mean annual precipitation), testing for tipping points in vegetation size structure and composition under different topography scenarios. We found that at warming levels above +2\u00b0C a threshold was crossed, with the system tipping into an alternative state. The system shifted from a conifer\u2010dominated landscape characterized by large trees to a landscape dominated by smaller, predominantly broadleaved trees. Topographic complexity moderated climate change impacts, smoothing and delaying the transitions between alternative vegetation states. We subsequently reversed the simulated climate forcing to assess the ability of the landscape to recover from climate change impacts. The forest landscape showed hysteresis, particularly in scenarios with lower precipitation. At the same mean annual temperature, equilibrium vegetation size structure and species composition differed between warming and cooling trajectories. Here we show that even moderate warming corresponding to current policy targets could result in critical transitions of forest ecosystems and highlight the importance of topographic complexity as a buffering agent. Furthermore, our results show that overshooting ambitious climate mitigation targets could be dangerous, as ecological impacts can be irreversible at millennial time scales once a tipping point has been crossed.",

We develop a model-free, machine-learning-based solution to both problems by exploiting reservoir computing to incorporate a parameter input channel. We demonstrate that, when the machine is trained in the normal functioning regime with a chaotic attractor (i.e., before the critical transition), the transition point can be predicted accurately. Remarkably, for a parameter drift through the critical point, the machine with the input parameter channel is able to predict not only that the system will be in a transient state, but also the distribution of the transient lifetimes and their average before the final collapse, revealing an important physical property of transient chaos.",

      "abstract": "Abstract Soil bacterial communities are pivotal in regulating terrestrial biogeochemical cycles and ecosystem functions. The increase in global nitrogen (N) deposition has impacted various aspects of terrestrial ecosystems, but we still have a rudimentary understanding of whether there is a threshold for N input level beyond which soil bacterial communities will experience critical transitions. Using high\u2010throughput sequencing of the 16S rRNA gene, we examined soil bacterial responses to a long\u2010term (13 yr), multi\u2010level, N addition experiment in a temperate steppe of northern China. We found that plant diversity decreased in a linear fashion with increasing N addition. However, bacterial diversity responded nonlinearly to N addition, such that it was unaffected by N input below 16 g N\u00b7m \u22122 \u00b7yr \u22121 , but decreased substantially when N input exceeded 32 g N\u00b7m \u22122 \u00b7yr \u22121 . A meta\u2010analysis across four N addition experiments in the same study region further confirmed this nonlinear response of bacterial diversity to N inputs. Substantial changes in soil bacterial community structure also occurred between N input levels of 16 to 32 g N\u00b7m \u22122 \u00b7yr \u22121 . Further analysis revealed that the loss of soil bacterial diversity was primarily attributed to the reduction in soil pH, whereas changes in soil bacterial community were driven by the combination of increased N availability, reduced soil pH, and changes in plant community structure. In addition, we found that N addition shifted bacterial communities toward more putatively copiotrophic taxa. Overall, our study identified a threshold of N input level for bacterial diversity and community composition. The nonlinear response of bacterial diversity to N input observed in our study indicates that although bacterial communities are resistant to low levels of N input, further increase in N input could trigger a critical transition, shifting bacterial communities to a low\u2010diversity state.",

Here, we introduce a powerful EWS, named dynamical eigenvalue (DEV), that is rooted in bifurcation theory of dynamical systems to estimate the dominant eigenvalue of the system. Theoretically, the absolute value of DEV approaches 1 when the system approaches bifurcation, while its position in the complex plane indicates the type of transition. We demonstrate the efficacy of the DEV approach in model systems with known bifurcation types and also test the DEV approach on various critical transitions in real-world systems.",

Guided by our simulations, we reveal both statistical and physical precursor signals of an approaching critical transition in reanalysis and observational data.

We employ landscape-flux theory from nonequilibrium statistical mechanics as a general framework to quantify the global stability of ecological systems and provide warning signals for critical transitions. We quantify the average flux as the nonequilibrium driving force and the dynamical origin of the nonequilibrium transition while the entropy production rate as the nonequilibrium thermodynamic cost and thermodynamic origin of the nonequilibrium transition. Average flux, entropy production, nonequilibrium free energy, and time irreversibility quantified by the difference in cross-correlation functions forward and backward in time can serve as early warning signals for critical transitions much earlier than other conventional predictors. We utilize a classical shallow lake model as an exemplar for our early warning prediction. Our proposed method is general and can be readily applied to assess the resilience of many other ecological systems.

      "abstract": "Many dynamical systems exhibit abrupt transitions or tipping as the control parameter is varied. In scenarios where the parameter is varied continuously, the rate of change of the control parameter greatly affects the performance of early warning signals (EWS) for such critical transitions. We study the impact of variation of the control parameter with a finite rate on the performance of EWS for critical transitions in a thermoacoustic system (a horizontal Rijke tube) exhibiting subcritical Hopf bifurcation. There is a growing interest in developing early warning signals for tipping in real systems. First, we explore the efficacy of early warning signals based on critical slowing down and fractal characteristics. From this study, lag-1 autocorrelation (AC) and Hurst exponent (H) are found to be good measures to predict the transition well before the tipping point. The warning time, obtained using AC and H, reduces with an increase in the rate of change of the control parameter following an inverse power law relation. Hence, for very fast rates, the warning time may be too short to perform any control action. Furthermore, we report the observation of a hyperexponential scaling relation between the AC and the variance of fluctuations during such a dynamic Hopf bifurcation. We construct a theoretical model for noisy Hopf bifurcation wherein the control parameter is continuously varied at different rates to study the effect of rate of change of the parameter on EWS. Similar results, including the hyperexponential scaling, are observed in the model as well.",

Phenomena like lake eutrophication, algal blooms, or reorganization in community composition belong to the most studied ecosystem regime shifts. However, although regime shifts have been well documented in several lakes, a global assessment of the prevalence of regime shifts is still missing, and, more in general, of the factors altering stability in lake status, is missing. Here, we provide a first global assessment of regime shifts and stability in the productivity of 1,015 lakes worldwide using trophic state index (TSI) time series derived from satellite imagery. We find that 12.8% of the lakes studied show regime shifts whose signatures are compatible with tipping points, while the number of detected regime shifts from low to high TSI has increased over time. Although our results suggest an overall stable picture for global lake dynamics, the limited instability signatures do not mean that lakes are insensitive to global change. Modeling the interaction between lake climatic, geophysical, and socioeconomic features and their stability properties, we find that the probability of a lake experiencing a tipping point increases with human population density in its catchment, while it decreases as the gross domestic product of that population increases. Our results show how quantifying lake productivity dynamics at a global scale highlights socioeconomic inequalities in conserving natural environments.",

      "abstract": "Abstract In recent years, the Southern Ocean has experienced extremely low sea ice cover in multiple summers. These low events were preceded by a multidecadal positive trend that culminated in record high ice coverage in 2014. This abrupt transition has led some authors to suggest that Antarctic sea ice has undergone a regime shift. In this study we analyze the satellite sea ice record and atmospheric reanalyses to assess the evidence for such a shift. We find that the standard deviation of the summer sea ice record has doubled from 0.31 million km 2 in 1979\u20132006 to 0.76 million km 2 for 2007\u201322. This increased variance is accompanied by a longer season-to-season sea ice memory. The atmosphere is the primary driver of Antarctic sea ice variability, but using a linear predictive model we show that sea ice changes cannot be explained by the atmosphere alone. Identifying whether a regime shift has occurred is difficult without a complete understanding of the physical mechanism of change. However, the statistical changes that we demonstrate (i.e., increased variance and autocorrelation, and a changed response to atmospheric forcing), as well as the increased spatial coherence noted by previous research, are indicators based on dynamical systems theory of an abrupt critical transition. Thus, our analysis is further evidence in support of a changed Antarctic sea ice system. Significance Statement In recent years, there have been several summers with extremely low Antarctic sea ice cover, including consecutive record lows in February 2022 and February 2023. Since then, the 2023 winter has seen a remarkably low sea ice growth with an anomaly far below expected climatology. This has led researchers to question whether there has been a regime shift, and we assess the observational evidence for such a shift. In the last decade or so, the variability of summer sea ice has almost doubled, accompanied by a much longer sea ice memory from season to season. These statistical changes, as well an increased spatial coherence noted by other researchers, are consistent with theoretical indicators of a critical transition, or regime shift.",

Understanding and predicting critical transitions are thus a key challenge in ecology. Previous studies have mainly focused on single environmental drivers (e.g. eutrophication) and early warning signals (EWSs) prior to population collapse. However, how multiple environmental stressors interact to shape ecological behaviour and whether EWSs were detectable prior to the recovery process in lake ecosystems are largely unknown. We present long\u2010term empirical evidence of the critical transition and hysteresis with the combined pressures of climate warming, eutrophication and trophic cascade effects by fish stocking in a subtropical Chinese lake in the Yangtze floodplain. The catastrophic regime shifts are cross\u2010validated by 64\u2010year multi\u2010trophic level monitoring data and paleo\u2010diatom records. We show that EWSs are detectable in both the collapse and recovery trajectories and that including body size information in composite EWSs requires shorter time\u2010series data and can improve the predictive ability of regime shifts. Although full recovery has not yet been observed, EWSs prior to recovery provide us with the opportunity to take measures for a clear\u2010water regime. Climate warming and top\u2010down cascade effects have a negative influence on water clarity by altering lower trophic level abundance and body size, which, in turn, have a negative effect on macrophyte abundance. Furthermore, we identify a shift in the dominant driving forces from bottom\u2010up to top\u2010down after regime shifts, decoupling the relationships between nutrients and biological components and thus decreasing the efficiency of nutrient reduction. Synthesis . This study provides new insights into ecological hysteresis under multiple external stressors and improves our understanding of trait\u2010based early warning signals in both the collapse and recovery processes in natural freshwater ecosystems. For management practice, our work suggests that slowing down climate warming and weakening the fish predation pressure on food webs are necessary to increase the effectiveness of nutrient reduction in the restoration of lakes.",

      "abstract": "Cyanobacterial blooms that form in response to climate warming and nutrient enrichment in freshwater lakes have become a global environmental challenge. Historical legacy effects and the mechanisms underlying cyanobacterial community succession are not well understood, especially for plateau lakes that are important global freshwater resources. This study investigated the temporal dynamics of cyanobacterial communities over centuries in response to nutrient enrichment and climate warming in low-latitude plateau lakes using high-throughput DNA sequencing of sedimentary DNA combined with traditional paleolimnological analyses. Our results confirmed that nutrients and climate warming drive shifts in cyanobacterial communities over time. Cyanobacterial community turnover was pronounced with regime shifts toward new ecological states, occurring after exceeding a tipping point of aquatic total phosphorus (TP). The inferred species interactions, niche differentiation, and identity of keystone taxa significantly changed after crossing the aquatic TP ecological threshold, as demonstrated by network analysis of cyanobacterial taxa. Further, the contribution of aquatic TP to cyanobacterial community dynamics was greater than that of air temperature when lakes were in an oligotrophic state. In contrast, as the aquatic TP threshold was exceeded, the contribution to community dynamics by air temperature increased and potentially surpassed that of aquatic TP. Overall, these results provide new evidence for how past nutrient levels in lacustrine ecosystems influence contemporary cyanobacterial community responses to global warming in low-latitude plateau lakes.",

      "abstract": "Abstract The occurrence of regime shifts in marine ecosystems has important implications for environmental legislation that requires setting reference levels and targets of quantitative restoration outcomes. The Baltic Sea ecosystem has undergone large changes in the 20 th century related to anthropogenic pressures and climate variability, which have caused ecosystem reorganization. Here, we compiled historical information and identified relationships in our dataset using multivariate statistics and modeling across 31 biotic and abiotic variables from 1925 to 2005 in the Central Baltic Sea. We identified a series of ecosystem regime shifts in the 1930s, 1970s, and at the end of the 1980s/beginning of the 1990s. In the long term, the Central Baltic Sea showed a regime shift from a benthic to pelagic\u2010dominated state. Historically, benthic components played a significant role in trophic transfer, while in the more recent productive system pelagic\u2013benthic coupling was weak and pelagic components dominated. Our analysis shows that for the entire time period, productivity, climate, and hydrography mainly affected the functioning of the food web, whereas fishing became important more recently. Eutrophication had far\u2010reaching direct and indirect impacts from a long\u2010term perspective and changed not only the trophic state of the system but also affected higher trophic levels. Our study also suggests a switch in regulatory drivers from salinity to oxygen. The \u201creference ecosystem\u201d identified in our analysis may guide the establishment of an ecosystem state baseline and threshold values for ecosystem state indicators of the Central Baltic Sea.",

      "abstract": "Abstract Gradual changes in the environment could cause dynamical ecological networks to suddenly shift from one state to an alternative state. When this happens ecosystem functions and services provided by ecological networks get disrupted. We, however, know very little about how the topology of such interaction networks can play a role in the transition of ecological networks when spatial interactions come into play. In the event of such unwanted transitions, little is known about how statistical metrics used to inform such impending transitions, measured at the species-level or at the community-level could relate to network architecture and the size of the metacommunity. Here, using hundred and one empirical plant-pollinator networks in a spatial setting, I evaluated the impact of network topology and spatial scale of species interactions on transitions, and on statistical metrics used as predictors to forecast such transitions. Using generalized Lotka-Volterra equations in a meta-network framework, I show that species dispersal rate and the size of the metacommunity can impact when a transition can occur. In addition, forecasting such unwanted transitions of meta-networks using statistical metrics of instability was also consequently dependent on the topology of the network, species dispersal rate, and the size of the metacommunity. The results indicated that the plant-pollinator meta-networks that could exhibit stronger statistical signals before collapse than others were dependent on their network architecture and on the spatial scale of species interactions.",

Specifically, the time-based connectedness and frequency-based connectedness of variables can be used to compute the net pairwise dynamic connectedness (NPDC), which originated as a volatility spillover index for financial markets studies in the field of econometrics. This work used the anomaly-detection benchmark Tennessee-Eastman chemical process (TEP) dataset, which consists of 41 measured variables and 11 manipulated variables subjected to various faulty operating conditions. The data analytics was performed using key functions from the R-package \u2018ConnectednessApproach\u2019 that implements connectedness computations based on time and frequency. The NPDC coefficient matrices were then transformed into network adjacency matrices for the rendering of the network topology of connectedness for TEP. The resulting network topologies allow a comprehensive analysis of oscillation effects across all plant-measured and manipulated variables. Analyzing the directed connectedness of the system dynamics at short-range, mid-range, and long-range frequencies showed how the oscillation effects of disturbances and faults propagate and dissipate in the short-term, mid-term, and long-term periods.",

Although previous theories have paved the way for evaluating net interaction effects by incorporating direct and indirect effects related to press perturbation, there are still critical knowledge gaps regarding the relationships between net interaction effects and network topologies because of lack of comparable interaction strengths across ecosystems. Location Global. Time period 1984\u20132020. Major taxa studied Aquatic organisms. Methods We compiled a global dataset of food webs with a consistent modelling method to estimate direct interaction strength. We revealed the general patterns of net interaction effects and their associations with network topologies by applying matrix theory and network analysis. Results In the examined food webs, the net (absolute) interaction strengths followed a right\u2010skewed pattern (many weak and few strong net strengths) and were significantly associated with various network\u2010 and species\u2010level topological structures. Indirect effects led to the emergence of net mutualism and competition effects rather than simply net predator\u2013prey interaction effects, and might play an important role in changing signs from direct to net interaction effects in species\u2010rich and highly connected food webs and for species with a large number of interaction partners. Main conclusions Our results highlight the ecological significance and necessity of linking net interaction effects with network topologies, which can help target ecosystems and species that are more vulnerable to sustained perturbation in the application of conservation and biodiversity management.",

One of the essential features that create complex network vulnerability to failure propagation is the dependency among their components, exposing entire systems to significant risks from destabilizing hazards such as human attacks, natural disasters or internal breakdowns. Developing realistic models for cascading failures as well as strategies to halt and mitigate the failure propagation can point to new approaches to restoring and strengthening real-world networks. In this review, we summarize recent progress on models developed based on physics and complex network science to understand the mechanisms, dynamics and overall impact of cascading failures. We present models for cascading failures in single networks and interdependent networks and explain how different dynamic propagation mechanisms can lead to an abrupt collapse and a rich dynamic behaviour. Finally, we close the review with novel emerging strategies for containing cascades of failures and discuss open questions that remain to be addressed.",

      "abstract": "In recent years, deep learning (DL) has attracted increasing attention in hyperspectral unmixing (HU) applications due to its powerful learning and data fitting ability. The autoencoder (AE) framework, as an unmixing baseline network, achieves good performance in HU by automatically learning low-dimensional embeddings and reconstructing data. Nevertheless, the conventional AE-based architecture, which focuses more on the pixel-level reconstruction loss, tends to lose some significant detailed information of certain materials (e.g., material-related properties) in the reconstruction process. Therefore, inspired by the perception mechanism, we propose a cycle-consistency unmixing network, called CyCU-Net, by learning two cascaded AEs in an end-to-end fashion, to enhance the unmixing performance more effectively. CyCU-Net is capable of reducing the detailed and material-related information loss in the process of reconstruction by relaxing the original pixel-level reconstruction assumption to cycle consistency dominated by the cascaded AEs. More specifically, cycle consistency can be achieved by a newly proposed self-perception loss, which consists of two spectral reconstruction terms and one abundance reconstruction term. By taking advantage of the self-perception loss in the network, the high-level semantic information can be well preserved in the unmixing process. Moreover, we investigate the performance gain of CyCU-Net with extensive ablation studies. Experimental results on one synthetic and three real hyperspectral data sets demonstrate the effectiveness and competitiveness of the proposed CyCU-Net in comparison with several state-of-the-art unmixing algorithms.",

However, the majority of existing CNN-based models maintain high performance with massive parameters and exceedingly deeper structures. Moreover, several algorithms essentially have underused the low-level features, thus causing relatively low performance. In this article, we address these problems by exploring two strategies based on novel local wider residual blocks (LWRBs) to effectively extract the image features for SISR. We propose a cascading residual network (CRN) that contains several locally sharing groups (LSGs), in which the cascading mechanism not only promotes the propagation of features and the gradient but also eases the model training. Besides, we present another enhanced residual network (ERN) for image resolution enhancement. ERN employs a dual global pathway structure that incorporates nonlocal operations to catch long-distance spatial features from the the original low-resolution (LR) input. To obtain the feature representation of the input at different scales, we further introduce a multiscale block (MSB) to directly detect low-level features from the LR image. The experimental results on four benchmark datasets have demonstrated that our models outperform most of the advanced methods while still retaining a reasonable number of parameters.",

      "abstract": "The deep convolutional neural network (CNN) has achieved great success in image recognition. Many image quality assessment (IQA) methods directly use recognition-oriented CNN for quality prediction. However, the properties of IQA task is different from image recognition task. Image recognition should be sensitive to visual content and robust to distortion, while IQA should be sensitive to both distortion and visual content. In this paper, an IQA-oriented CNN method is developed for blind IQA (BIQA), which can efficiently represent the quality degradation. CNN is large-data driven, while the sizes of existing IQA databases are too small for CNN optimization. Thus, a large IQA dataset is firstly established, which includes more than one million distorted images (each image is assigned with a quality score as its substitute of Mean Opinion Score (MOS), abbreviated as pseudo-MOS). Next, inspired by the hierarchical perception mechanism (from local structure to global semantics) in human visual system, a novel IQA-orientated CNN method is designed, in which the hierarchical degradation is considered. Finally, by jointly optimizing the multilevel feature extraction, hierarchical degradation concatenation (HDC) and quality prediction in an end-to-end framework, the Cascaded CNN with HDC (named as CaHDC) is introduced. Experiments on the benchmark IQA databases demonstrate the superiority of CaHDC compared with existing BIQA methods. Meanwhile, the CaHDC (with about 0.73M parameters) is lightweight comparing to other CNN-based BIQA models, which can be easily realized in the microprocessing system.

Tipping points are critical thresholds in system parameters or state variables at which a tiny perturbation can lead to a qualitative change of the system. Many systems with tipping points can be modeled as networks of coupled multistable subsystems, e.g., coupled patches of vegetation, connected lakes, interacting climate tipping elements, and multiscale infrastructure systems. In such networks, tipping events in one subsystem are able to induce tipping cascades via domino effects. Here, we investigate the effects of network topology on the occurrence of such cascades. Numerical cascade simulations with a conceptual dynamical model for tipping points are conducted on Erd\u0151s-R\u00e9nyi, Watts-Strogatz, and Barab\u00e1si-Albert networks. Additionally, we generate more realistic networks using data from moisture-recycling simulations of the Amazon rainforest and compare the results to those obtained for the model networks. We furthermore use a directed configuration model and a stochastic block model which preserve certain topological properties of the Amazon network to understand which of these properties are responsible for its increased vulnerability. We find that clustering and spatial organization increase the vulnerability of networks and can lead to tipping of the whole network. These results could be useful to evaluate which systems are vulnerable or robust due to their network topology and might help us to design or manage systems accordingly.",

We study different features of Lipizzaner\u2019s evolutionary computation methodology. Our ablation experiments determine that communication, selection, parameter optimization, and ensemble optimization each, as well as in combination, play critical roles.

In addition, we show a GAN-training feature of Lipizzaner: the ability to train simultaneously with different loss functions in the gradient descent parameter learning framework of each GAN at each cell. We use an image generation problem to show that different loss function combinations result in models with better accuracy and more diversity in comparison to other existing evolutionary GAN models. Finally, Lipizzaner with multiple loss function options promotes the best model diversity while requiring a large grid size for adequate accuracy.",

Inspired by such phenomena, we construct a two-layer multiplex network for the coupled spread of a disease and conflicting opinions. We model each process as a contagion. On one layer, we consider the concurrent evolution of two opinions \u2014 pro-physical-distancing and anti-physical-distancing \u2014 that compete with each other and have mutual immunity to each other. The disease evolves on the other layer, and individuals are less likely (respectively, more likely) to become infected when they adopt the pro-physical-distancing (respectively, anti-physical-distancing) opinion. We develop approximations of mean-field type by generalizing monolayer pair approximations to multilayer networks; these approximations agree well with Monte Carlo simulations for a broad range of parameters and several network structures. Through numerical simulations, we illustrate the influence of opinion dynamics on the spread of the disease from complex interactions both between the two conflicting opinions and between the opinions and the disease. We find that lengthening the duration that individuals hold an opinion may help suppress disease transmission, and we demonstrate that increasing the cross-layer correlations or intra-layer correlations of node degrees may lead to fewer individuals becoming infected with the disease.",

      "abstract": "Deep neural networks (DNNs), characterized by sophisticated architectures capable of learning a hierarchy of feature representations, have achieved remarkable successes in various applications. Learning DNN's parameters is a crucial but challenging task that is commonly resolved by using gradient-based backpropagation (BP) methods. However, BP-based methods suffer from severe initialization sensitivity and proneness to getting trapped into inferior local optima. To address these issues, we propose a DNN learning framework that hybridizes CC-based optimization with BP-based gradient descent, called BPCC, and implement it by devising a computationally efficient CC-based optimization technique dedicated to DNN parameter learning. In BPCC, BP will intermittently execute for multiple training epochs. Whenever the execution of BP in a training epoch cannot sufficiently decrease the training objective function value, CC will kick in to execute by using the parameter values derived by BP as the starting point. The best parameter values obtained by CC will act as the starting point of BP in its next training epoch. In CC-based optimization, the overall parameter learning task is decomposed into many subtasks of learning a small portion of parameters. These subtasks are individually addressed in a cooperative manner. In this article, we treat neurons as basic decomposition units. Furthermore, to reduce the computational cost, we devise a maturity-based subtask selection strategy to selectively solve some subtasks of higher priority. Experimental results demonstrate the superiority of the proposed method over common-practice DNN parameter learning techniques.",

      "abstract": "While actors in a population can interact with anyone else freely, social relations significantly influence our inclination toward particular individuals. The consequence of such interactions, however, may also form the intensity of our relations established earlier. These dynamical processes are captured via a coevolutionary model staged in multiplex networks with two distinct layers. In a so-called relationship layer, the weights of edges among players may change in time as a consequence of games played in the alternative interaction layer. As an reasonable assumption, bilateral cooperation confirms while mutual defection weakens these weight factors. Importantly, the fitness of a player, which basically determines the success of a strategy imitation, depends not only on the payoff collected from interactions, but also on the individual relationship index calculated from the mentioned weight factors of related edges. Within the framework of weak prisoner\u2019s dilemma situation, we explore the potential outcomes of the mentioned coevolutionary process where we assume different topologies for relationship layer. We find that higher average degree of the relationship graph is more beneficial to maintain cooperation in regular graphs, but the randomness of links could be a decisive factor in harsh situations. Surprisingly, a stronger coupling between relationship index and fitness discourage the evolution of cooperation by weakening the direct consequence of a strategy change. To complete our study, we also monitor how the distribution of relationship index vary and detect a strong relation between its polarization and the general cooperation level.",

In response to this reality, we propose a dynamic model of information-awareness-epidemic-activity coevolution on a four-layer network. Our findings reveal the presence of an optimal coupling between information contact preference and activity contact preference, which efficiently suppresses epidemic spreading. Specifically, the disease-related information should be targeted towards individuals who engage in more activities, enhancing their awareness and resistance to infection. Examining the epidemic situation, we observe that the epidemic threshold can be moderately increased with higher information levels but significantly decreased with increased activity frequency. Quantitatively, we establish that the epidemic threshold is strictly inversely proportional to the activity frequency. By integrating the microscopic Markov chain approach with the mean-field method, we provide theoretical insights into the system's state size and epidemic threshold. We derive an explicit expression for the critical combination of information level and activity frequency required to prevent epidemic outbreaks. These results are consistently supported by extensive Monte Carlo simulations on both heterogeneous scale-free multiplex networks and homogeneous Erd\u0151s-R\u00e9nyi multiplex networks. This research emphasizes the crucial importance of reducing physical contact through activities as a key preventive measure against epidemics, complementing the focus on information dissemination to raise awareness.",

The cross\u2010sectional design of much policy research does not allow an examination of these potentially complementary forces that shape belief systems and networks. These dynamics are studied using data on policy beliefs and networking in the U.S. environmental risk policy subsystem across two time periods, 1985 and 2000 (N = 223).

This coupled dynamics coevolves with dynamical changes of the topology of the network caused by a link rewiring mechanism. Such coevolution model features the interaction of the local dynamics of node and link states with the nonlocal dynamics of link rewiring in a random network. The coupled dynamics of the states of the nodes and the links produces by itself an absorbing phase transition which is shown to be robust against the link rewiring mechanism. However, the dynamics of the network gives rise to significant physical changes, specially in the limit in which some links do not change state but are always rewired. Firstly a network fragmentation occurs at the critical line of the absorbing-state transition, and only at this line, so that fragmentation is a manifestation of criticality. Secondly, in the active phase of the absorbing-state transition, finite-size fluctuations take the system to a single network component consensus phase, while other configurations are possible in the absence of rewiring. In addition, this phase is reached after a survival time that scales linearly with system size, while the survival time scales exponentially with system size when there is no rewiring. A social interpretation of our results contribute to the description of processes of emergence of social fragmentation and polarization.",

As differential privacy is becoming a de facto standard for privacy preservation, recently results have emerged integrating differential privacy with distributed optimization. However, directly incorporating differential privacy design in existing distributed optimization approaches significantly compromises optimization accuracy. In this article, we propose to redesign and tailor gradient methods for differentially private distributed optimization, and propose two differential-privacy oriented gradient methods that can ensure both rigorous <inline-formula xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\"><tex-math notation=\"LaTeX\">$\\epsilon$</tex-math></inline-formula> -differential privacy and optimality. The first algorithm is based on static-consensus-based gradient methods, and the second algorithm is based on dynamic-consensus (gradient-tracking) based distributed optimization methods and, hence, is applicable to general directed interaction graph topologies. Both algorithms can simultaneously ensure almost sure convergence to an optimal solution and a finite privacy budget, even when the number of iterations goes to infinity. To the best of authors' knowledge, this is the first time that both goals are achieved simultaneously.

In most existing distributed optimization approaches, all generators explicitly exchange their states with neighbors to obtain the optimal solution, which may result in disclosing the privacy information of generators. This problem becomes worse if there are some adversaries aimed at inferring privacy information from the communication network for nefarious purposes. For privacy preservation, a privacy preserving distributed optimization algorithm over time-varying directed communication networks is proposed in this article by adding conditional noises to the exchanged states. It is proved that this proposed algorithm is able to solve the EDP. Moreover, the convergence rate and privacy analysis of the proposed algorithm are also shown in this article.

Despite its complex derivation, based on several duality steps, the distributed algorithm has a very simple and intuitive structure. That is, each node finds a primal-dual optimal solution pair of a local relaxed version of the original problem and then updates suitable auxiliary local variables. We prove that agents asymptotically compute their portion of an optimal (feasible) solution of the original problem.

Mathematical modeling of asynchronous methods involves proper accounting of information delays, which makes their analysis challenging. This article reviews recent developments in the design and analysis of asynchronous optimization methods, covering both centralized methods, where all processors update a master copy of the optimization variables, and decentralized methods, where each processor maintains a local copy of the variables.

      "abstract": "In this article, we study the event-triggered distributed optimization problem of second-order nonlinear multiagent systems under undirected and connected communication topologies. To reduce the cost of information exchange in an optimization problem, a distributed event-triggered communication-based algorithm is proposed. In an event-triggered mechanism, the information interaction process of the network is controlled by a set of trigger conditions. The trigger condition of each agent only requires its own state information and its neighboring agents' state information. Each agent updates its own states only at the triggering time. In order to achieve the optimal result of the optimization problem and reduce the cost of communicatio, we propose a distributed event-triggered algorithm based on gradient descent. Moreover, we analyze the convergence of the algorithm by constructing a suitable Lyapunov function. Furthermore, we prove that the Zeno behavior can be avoid. Finally, we provide examples to validate the effectiveness of the obtained result.",

      "abstract": "Optimization Spiking Neural P System (OSNPS) is the first membrane computing model to directly derive an approximate solution of combinatorial problems with a specific reference to the 0/1 knapsack problem. OSNPS is composed of a family of parallel Spiking Neural P Systems (SNPS) that generate candidate solutions of the binary combinatorial problem and a Guider algorithm that adjusts the spiking probabilities of the neurons of the P systems. Although OSNPS is a pioneering structure in membrane computing optimization, its performance is competitive with that of modern and sophisticated metaheuristics for the knapsack problem only in low dimensional cases. In order to overcome the limitations of OSNPS, this paper proposes a novel Dynamic Guider algorithm which employs an adaptive learning and a diversity-based adaptation to control its moving operators. The resulting novel membrane computing model for optimization is here named Adaptive Optimization Spiking Neural P System (AOSNPS). Numerical result shows that the proposed approach is effective to solve the 0/1 knapsack problems and outperforms multiple various algorithms proposed in the literature to solve the same class of problems even for a large number of items (high dimensionality). Furthermore, case studies show that a AOSNPS is effective in fault sections estimation of power systems in different types of fault cases: including a single fault, multiple faults and multiple faults with incomplete and uncertain information in the IEEE 39 bus system and IEEE 118 bus system.",

We directly and simultaneously learn phase stability and bandgap tunability from chemical composition alone to efficiently discover all superior compositions on the design Pareto front.

However, data locality does not provide sufficient privacy protection, and it is desirable to facilitate FL with rigorous differential privacy (DP) guarantee. Existing DP mechanisms would introduce random noise with magnitude proportional to the model size, which can be quite large in deep neural networks. In this paper, we propose a new FL framework with sparsification-amplified privacy. Our approach integrates random sparsification with gradient perturbation on each agent to amplify privacy guarantee. Since sparsification would increase the number of communication rounds required to achieve a certain target accuracy, which is unfavorable for DP guarantee, we further introduce acceleration techniques to help reduce the privacy cost. We rigorously analyze the convergence of our approach and utilize Renyi DP to tightly account the end-to-end DP guarantee. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets validate that our approach outperforms previous differentially-private FL approaches in both privacy guarantee and communication efficiency.",

Unfortunately, GPs become less practical for high-dimensional multiobjective and many-objective optimization as their computational complexity is cubic in the number of training samples. In this article, we propose a computationally efficient dropout neural network (EDN) to replace the Gaussian process and a new model management strategy to achieve a good balance between convergence and diversity for assisting evolutionary algorithms to solve high-dimensional multiobjective and many-objective expensive optimization problems. While the conventional dropout neural network needs to save a large number of network models during the training for calculating the confidence level, only one single network model is needed in the EDN to estimate the fitness and its confidence level by randomly ignoring neurons in both training and testing the neural network. Extensive experimental studies on benchmark problems with up to 100 decision variables and 20 objectives demonstrate that, compared to state of the art, the proposed algorithm is not only highly competitive in performance but also computationally more scalable to high-dimensional many-objective optimization problems. Finally, the proposed algorithm is validated on an operational optimization problem of crude oil distillation units, further confirming its capability of handling expensive problems given a limited computational budget.",

However, with the increased number of decision variables in EMOPs, the prediction accuracy of surrogate models will deteriorate, which inevitably worsens the performance of SAEAs. To deal with this issue, this article suggests an ensemble surrogate-based framework for tackling EMOPs. In this framework, a global surrogate model is trained under the entire search space to explore the global area, while a number of surrogate submodels are trained under different search subspaces to exploit the subarea, so as to enhance the prediction accuracy and reliability. Moreover, a new infill sampling criterion is designed based on a set of reference vectors to select promising samples for training the models. To validate the generality and effectiveness of our framework, three state-of-the-art evolutionary algorithms [nondominated sorting genetic algorithm III (NSGA-III), multiobjective evolutionary algorithm based on decomposition with differential evolution (MOEA/D-DE) and reference vector-guided evolutionary algorithm (RVEA)] are embedded, which significantly improve their performance for solving most of the test EMOPs adopted in this article.

The six schemes, including grasshopper optimization algorithm (GOA), cat swarm optimization (CSO), weed algorithm (WA), genetic algorithm (GA), krill algorithm (KA), and particle swarm optimization (PSO), were used to hybridize for improving the performance of ANN, SVM, and ANFIS models. Groundwater level (GWL) data of Ardebil plain (Iran) for a period of 144 months were selected to evaluate the hybrid models. The pre-processing technique of principal component analysis (PCA) was applied to reduce input combinations from monthly time series up to 12-month prediction intervals. The results showed that the ANFIS-GOA was superior to the other hybrid models for predicting GWL in the first piezometer (RMSE:1.21, MAE:0.878, NSE:0.93, PBIAS:0.15, R2:0.93), second piezometer (RMSE:1.22, MAE:0.881, NSE:0.92, PBIAS:0.17, R2:0.94), and third piezometer (RMSE:1.23, MAE:0.911, NSE:0.91, PBIAS:0.19, R2:0.94) in the testing stage. The performance of hybrid models with optimization algorithms was far better than that of classical ANN, ANFIS, and SVM models without hybridization. The percent of improvements in the ANFIS-GOA versus standalone ANFIS in piezometer 10 were 14.4%, 3%, 17.8%, and 181% for RMSE, MAE, NSE, and PBIAS in training stage and 40.7%, 55%, 25%, and 132% in testing stage, respectively.
