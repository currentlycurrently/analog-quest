      "explanation": "Both mechanisms describe how spatial interaction zones and distance-dependent influence decay govern collective motion and flocking. The physics model focuses on mathematical exponents of influence decay, while the biology model describes three functional zones (repulsion/alignment/attraction). These are structurally identical - both explain emergent collective behavior through spatial influence gradients.",
