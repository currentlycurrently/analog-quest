  "explanation": "Both papers study binary state systems with nearest-neighbor interactions. The math paper applies this to math systems, while the q-bio paper uses the identical mathematical framework for q-bio applications. Despite the different domains, the underlying mathematics (H = -J \u03a3 \u03c3i \u03c3j - h \u03a3 \u03c3i) is isomorphic.",

    "abstract": "We study the excursion decomposition of the two-dimensional critical XOR-Ising model with either $+$ or free boundary conditions. In the first part, we construct the decomposition directly in the continuum. This construction relies on the identification of the XOR-Ising field with the cosine or sine of a Gaussian free field (GFF) $\u03c6$ multiplied by $\u03b1= 1/\\sqrt{2}$, and is obtained by an appropriate exploration of two-valued level sets of the GFF. More generally, the same construction applies to t"

    "abstract": "Transcription factors (TFs) regulate gene expression by binding to specific genomic loci determined by DNA sequence. Their sequence specificity is commonly summarized by a consensus binding motif. However, eukaryotic genomes contain billions of low-affinity DNA sequences to which TFs associate with a sequence-dependent binding energy. We currently lack insight into how the genomic sequence defines this spectrum of binding energies and the resulting pattern of TF localization. Here, we set out to"
