  "explanation": "Both papers study binary state systems with nearest-neighbor interactions. The math paper applies this to math systems, while the q-bio paper uses the identical mathematical framework for q-bio applications. Despite the different domains, the underlying mathematics (H = -J \u03a3 \u03c3i \u03c3j - h \u03a3 \u03c3i) is isomorphic.",

    "abstract": "We construct a natural coupling between the continuum Gaussian free field (GFF) and the critical Ising magnetisation field (IMF) in a planar domain. In fact, we show that two independent IMFs with $+$ boundary conditions and two independent IMFs with free boundary conditions are a deterministic function of a single instance of the GFF together with a sequence of independent coin flips. This construction should be seen as an extension of the bosonisation phenomenon, and to the best of our knowled"

    "abstract": "Transcription factors (TFs) regulate gene expression by binding to specific genomic loci determined by DNA sequence. Their sequence specificity is commonly summarized by a consensus binding motif. However, eukaryotic genomes contain billions of low-affinity DNA sequences to which TFs associate with a sequence-dependent binding energy. We currently lack insight into how the genomic sequence defines this spectrum of binding energies and the resulting pattern of TF localization. Here, we set out to"
